     <!-- The following naming scheme has been used in the
          construction of anchor names:

             For the "Nth Generation - xxxxx I"    (Joseph I etc)

                anchor at entry-name (eg Isaac):
                  <a name="Xx-ISAAC_(N-1)" id="Xx-ISAAC_(N-1)"></a>
                          where Xx is short form of Isaac's father's name
                          and _(N-1) is in Roman numerals
                                 eg Jh-ISAAC_VII

                link back to parents of entry-name (eg James
                  Horton and Martha White):
                  <a href="#Yy-JAMES_(N-2)">James ..... White</a>
                          where Yy is short form of James' father's name
                          and _(N-2) is in Roman numerals eg _VI

                link forward from children of entry-name (eg Martha):
                  <a href="#Zz-MARTHA_(N)">Martha Maria</a>
                          where Zz is short form of Martha's father's name
                          and _(N) is in Roman numerals eg _VIII

             There are four generational trees in this book, for the four
             sons of (the Root) Barnabas Horton. Occasionally an anchor
             name in one tree was the same as one in another tree; in these
             cases a suffix 'a' or 'aa' was used to differentiate them.

             The short form of a father's name (Xx above) is two characters
             in the 'Joseph I' and 'Caleb I' trees.  It is three chars long
             in the 'Joshua I' and 'Jonathan I' trees, to minimize anchor
             name duplication requiring an a or aa suffix.

<div class="transnote">
<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>All changes noted in the ERRATA (at the front of the book) have been
applied to the etext.</p>

<p>As the ERRATA states: "Errors in spelling, and occasionally
discrepancies in dates may be found, but their correction will
readily suggest itself to the reader." Errors in dates, even
seemingly obvious ones, have not been corrected.
However in the web version of this etext, a date that is likely
incorrect is underlined with a dotted line and a mouse-hover will
show the (probable) corrected date.</p>

<p>The list of children given in almost every entry in the geneology is
presented in several different formats throughout the original text.
These different inconsistent formats are retained in the etext.</p>

<p>When a listed child has a more detailed entry in the section relating to
the next generation, that child will have a link forward to that detailed
entry. Only a small percentage of listed children have a more detailed entry,
perhaps 10-15%.</p>

<p>When a detailed entry names the parents, the parents will have a link
back to the father's (sometimes the mother's) detailed entry in the prior
generation section when such an entry exists, which it does about 95% of the time).</p>

<p>The two Indexes are incomplete and contain many errors. With a few
exceptions these errors have not been adjusted; one valid page number
has been added to an entry when none was present in the original Index.</p>

<p>Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been
corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within
the text and consultation of external sources.</p>

<p class="customcover">The cover image was created by the transcriber
and is placed in the public domain.</p>

<p>More detail of changes made can be found at <a href="#TN">the end of the book.</a></p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE_INTRODUCTION" id="PREFACE_INTRODUCTION">PREFACE&mdash;INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>


<p>We give <span class="smcap">Barnabas Horton</span> as the <em>Preface</em> and Introduction to this
little volume of Chronicles. He was probably the son of Joseph
Horton, of Leicestershire, England, and born in the little hamlet of
Mousely of that shire. Of his history before he came to America very
little is known. He came over in the ship "<i>Swallow</i>" in 1633&ndash;38.
He landed at Hampton, Mass. How long he remained at Hampton
is not known. But in 1640 we find him with his wife and two children
in New Haven, Conn., in company with the Rev. John Youngs,
William Welles, Esq., Peter Hallock, John Tuthill, Richard Terry,
Thomas Mapes, Matthias Corwin, Robert Ackerly, Jacob Corey, John
Conklin, Isaac Arnold, and John Budd, and on the 21st day of
Oct., 1640, assisted by the venerable Rev. John Davenport and Gov.
Eaton, they organized themselves into a Congregational Church, and
sailed to the east end of Long Island, now Southold. They had all
been members of Puritan churches in England, and all had families
with them except Peter Hallock. They doubtless had been on the
island previous to this time and looked out their homes. On nearing
the shore they cast lots to decide who should first set foot on the land.
The lot fell on Peter Hallock, and the place where he stepped upon
the land has ever since been known as Hallock's Landing.</p>

<p>On coming ashore, they all knelt down and engaged in prayer,
Peter Hallock leading, as had been determined by the lot. These
were the first persons of any civilized nation that had ever attempted
to settle on the east end of Long Island. <cite>See Griffin's Journal.</cite></p>

<p>Barnabas Horton was a man of deep-toned piety, and a warm advocate
of civil and religious freedom. He was one of the most prominent
and influential men of Southold. He was for many years a
magistrate, and several times a member of the General Court at New
Haven and Harford. He built the first framed dwelling-house ever
erected on the east of Long Island, and that house is still (1875)
standing and occupied. It is a shingle-house, that is, shingles are
used for weather-boards, and the sides have never been reshingled,
and the roof but once, according to the statement of Jonathan Goldsmith
Horton, the last Horton occupant of the old house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>It is said that Barnabas Horton I. was large in stature, and of a
ruddy complexion, and of fine social qualities.</p>

<p>His tombstone is of English blue marble, five feet long and about
three feet wide. It is placed horizontally over the grave. The stone
was re-lettered about fifty or sixty years ago by Jonathan G. Horton.
It is elevated about eighteen inches from the ground, on a good stone
base. The original base was of brick, but it had all crumbled down
many years ago. The present base was put under the stone at the
time it was re-lettered by Jonathan G. Horton.</p>

<p>The inscription surrounds the border of the stone, and reads as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquoty">

<p>"Here lieth buried the body of <span class="smcap">Mr. Barnabas Horton</span>, who was born at
Mousely, Leicestershire, Old England, and died at Southold, on the 13th day of
July, 1680, aged 80 years."</p></div>

<p>In the centre of the stone we find the Epitaph, as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Here lies my body tombed in dust</p>
<p class="verse">'Till Christ shall come to raise it with the just;</p>
<p class="verse">My soul ascended to the throne of God,</p>
<p class="verse">Where with sweet Jesus now I make abode:</p>
<p class="verse">Then hasten after me, my dearest wife,</p>
<p class="verse">To be partaker of this blessed life;</p>
<p class="verse">And you, dear children, all follow the Lord,</p>
<p class="verse">Hear and obey His public sacred word;</p>
<p class="verse">And in your houses call upon His name,</p>
<p class="verse">For oft I have advised you to the same:</p>
<p class="verse">Then God will bless you with your children all,</p>
<p class="verse">And to this blessed place He will you call."</p>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquoty">

<p>Heb. xi: 4.&mdash;"He being dead, yet speaketh."</p></div>

<p>It is said that this epitaph was written by himself, and that it, together
with the inscription, date of his death excepted, was all put
upon the stone before he died. He was the only one of the original
thirteen who brought his tombstone with him, and this fact seems to
indicate a commendable desire to see that his name and memory
should not perish from the earth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;We have followed <cite>Griffin's Journal</cite> in relation to the thirteen old Puritans
who first settled in Southold. But C. B. Moore, Esq., of New York City, who
has been more thorough and faithful than any other person, in studying the history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
and genealogy of the early settlers of Southold&mdash;examining all the <em>deeds</em> and <em>wills</em>,
and other authentic documents to be found, and also copying the inscriptions from
every headstone, not only in Southold, but over nearly the whole Island&mdash;makes it
very evident that some of those named were not there at so early a date, and he
also says that <em>Peter</em> Hallock, who is named as one of the thirteen, was the grandson
of the Puritan Hallock who settled at Southold, and whose Christian name was
William. Mr. Moore is one of the best genealogists of the country, and in relation
to Long Island, he is the best authority extant.</p></div>


<hr class="r10" />
<h3>MORE ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE.</h3>

<p>It will be seen by the engraving that the old house is double. The
western part is that which was built by Barnabas in 1659&ndash;60. The
east or two-story part was built by Jonathan I., about 1682. The upper
room of this part was used for a court-house for nearly twenty years,
as we learn from Thompson's History of Long Island, and some of
the old benches used when it was a court-house are still preserved.
The old "castle," as Jonathan G. Horton, its last Horton occupant,
used to call it, is in all probability the oldest wood house in America.
I know of no dwelling-house of any kind, stone or brick, now standing,
that can date back as far as this venerable old mansion. There
were a few huts on the east of Long Island previous to 1640&mdash;two or
three it is said on Shelter Island. But these, as well as those built by
the Puritans, immediately on their settlement in Southold, soon all
passed away. Not a vestige of any of the first generation buildings
can be found except this one. It remained for the house that Barnabas
built to survive the wreck of ages, and to stand to-day as a noble
representative of the dwellings of two hundred and fifteen years ago.
But the old house stands to-day not only as peering above all others
by its age, but also by its occupancy. It is not very often that we find
two generations of the same name, living and dying in the same house&mdash;rarely
find three. But here we have six generations in succession, all
bearing the Horton name, living and dying in the same house, and
all born in it except Barnabas I., and his son Jonathan. We may go
to the castles and palaces of the old world, and search long and diligently,
and fail to find a parallel case.</p>

<p>With a few repairs, the old castle may yet stand for generations far
in the future.</p>

<p>It requires some thought and reflection to realize the lapse of time
since the old house was built. See the old Puritan himself there
twenty years; then his son Jonathan, twenty-eight years; and then
Jonathan, Jr., about sixty years; and next Lawrence and <em>his</em> son Jona<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>than
over a half a century; and lastly Jonathan G. Horton, about a
half a century; making in all two hundred and thirteen years at the
death of Jonathan G. Horton, 3 July, 1873. These six generations
all living and dying in the old mansion! Could those old walls re-echo
all the words ever spoken there, and exhibit anew all the scenes
ever witnessed there&mdash;the book containing such a record would vastly
exceed in volume the size of the old castle. It would bring to light
much that is now in darkness, and must forever remain hidden from
the generations of the living.</p>

<p>At the death of Jonathan G. Horton, the old homestead became,
by will, the property of the Rev. Mrs. Williams, of Brooklyn, N. Y.,
who was the adopted daughter of Jonathan G. Horton, he never
having had issue, so that on the 3d of July, 1873, the old homestead
went out of the Horton name.</p>

<p>Mrs. Williams proposes to sell it, and if some of the Hortons do
not buy it, it will indicate a lack of decent respect for the old castle,
if not for the Horton name. It should be bought back into the
Horton name, suitably repaired and preserved for the wonder and
admiration of generations of Hortons yet unborn. Jonathan G.
Horton, the short, thick man, and Stuart T. Terry, are the two men
seen in the engraving, in front of the old house.</p>

<p>Mr. Stuart T. Terry, of Southold, L. I., has kindly copied and forwarded
to me, many interesting facts from the New Haven Colonial
Records, some of which are here inserted:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"Concerning some farmers neere Southold, at a place called Hashamamock,
aboute whom <span class="smcap">Barnabas Horton</span>, one of ye Constables last
yeare, which was 1656, also, Constable in 1659. 29 May, 1661, Barnabas
Horton was a Deputy to the New Haven Court&mdash;also, 31 May,
1654, the Deputies from Southold, presented to ye court a wrighting
from their towne, wherein it is desired that <span class="smcap">Barnabas Horton</span> and
<span class="smcap">John Peaken</span>, the two present Deputies of Southold, may be chosen
Constables for that plantation; which was done. Barnabas Horton
was a Deputy to the Court in New Haven, in 1654-'56-'58-'59 and
1661. In 1655 there was no election, but he wrote a letter to the
Court on public affairs. In 1662 he was admitted a Freeman of Connecticut
Colony, at Harford, and in 1663 and 1664 he was a Deputy
to the General Court, at Harford. He was a Magistrate in 1664, and
until his death. He is one of the Patentees of the Town of Southold
in 1676." Made his will May 10, 1680. Died 13 July, 1680. Will
proved. Lib. 2, N. Y., p. 54.&mdash;<cite>Vide "Moore's Indexes of Southold."</cite></p></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE OLD BIBLE.</h3>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting relic left by our good old ancestor,
Barnabas, is the <span class="smcap">old Bible</span>, which he brought with him from England.
It is now in the possession of the Hon. Silas Horton, of Southold.
It was taken to the Bible House, New York, some years ago, and carefully
repaired, and every torn leaf mended, so that it is now entire,
and in a good condition.</p>

<p>We find in it the following record:</p>

<div class="fs80">
<p class="center">"Imprinted at London, by the Deputies of Christian Barker."</p>

<p class="p1 center"><em>Printer to the Queen's Most Excellent Majestie, 1597.</em></p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Cum Privilegio.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Then follows in manuscript:</p>

<div class="fs80">
<p>"Barnabas Horton, to his son Jonathan Horton, this <span class="smcap">Bible</span> he did bequeath, in
the year of our Lord, 1680."</p>
</div>

<p>Then follows:</p>

<div class="fs80">
<p>"Capt. Jonathan Horton, his <em>Book</em>. <em>God give him grace.</em> Jonathan Horton, 1683."</p>
</div>

<p>In another place, and probably in the handwriting of Jonathan
Horton, Jr., we find:</p>

<div class="fs80">
<p>"<em>The Word of the Lord God of Jonathan Horton, 1748-'49.</em>"</p>
</div>

<p>Again we find:</p>

<div class="fs80">
<p>"Lydia Tuthill, her <em>Book</em>, given her by her mother, as it is said."</p>
</div>

<p>And then follows:</p>

<div class="fs80">
<p>"Feb. 8, in the year 1742, then Jonathan Tuthill departed this life&mdash;the son of
Henry Tuthill and Bethia (Horton) Tuthill. Susanna Tuthill, wife of Jonathan
Tuthill, departed this life May 16, in the year 1743, in the 50th year of her age.
Henry Tuthill, departed this life the 4th day of January, in the year 1750, aged 84.
Bethia Tuthill, wife of Henry Tuthill, departed this life March 16th, 1744, in the
73d year of her age."</p>

<h3>OLD MUSKET, CASK, AND WALKING STAFF.</h3>

<p><em>The old wood hooks</em> are still attached to the big beam of the old
house, upon which Barnabas used to hang his <span class="smcap">old musket</span>, which was
called "uncle Barney's <em>quart pot</em>." He brought it with him from
England. It is now in the possession of Barnabas B. Horton, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
Southold. It is still a long old gun, though not as long as it was
once, as it was bursted by overloading on one Thanksgiving Day, and
about eight or ten inches of the muzzle cut off.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">CASK</span>, in which he packed a portion of his household goods,
and brought over with him, is still in existence, and is owned by
Gilbert W. Horton, of Bay View, Southold. It is doubly historic
from the fact that when the British invaded Long Island it was filled
with wheat and buried, thus securing the wheat from the foraging
parties of the British army. It is made of solid oak&mdash;hoops and all&mdash;the
hoops are square and about an inch and a quarter thick&mdash;only one
hoop missing. It is used for a grain cask, and will hold about fifteen
bushels. It was formerly called "uncle Barney's money barrel," as
romance had it, that he brought it over full of gold and silver.</p>

<p>His <span class="fs70">WALKING STAFF</span> is still preserved. It is made of the Yew tree
wood, has a fine ivory head with the letters "J. H." and the figures
"1617" in apparently golden specks indented into it, from which it
would seem that it once belonged to his father, and that J. H. (Joseph
Horton) were his initials. It is now owned by Silas R. Horton, of
Goshen, N. Y.</p>

<p>Many other mementos of the old Puritan are in existence, some of
them in the Long Island Historical Rooms, Brooklyn, N. Y.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<h3><span class="smcap">The HORTON NAME&mdash;First Settlers in this Country.</span></h3>

<p>The word Horton in the Anglo-Saxon language means an enclosure,
or garden of vegetables. It is said to be derived from <em>ort</em> and <em>tun</em>,
<em>ort</em>, meaning plant, and <em>tun</em>, enclosed. The name is evidently of
Latin origin, and has been known in England ever since the conquest
of Cæsar.</p>

<p>The Hortons in England, and their descendants in America, have
generally been cultivators of the soil. They have been found almost
universally in the middle class of society, and it is not known that
any royal blood has ever coursed in their veins. They are, and always
have been, <em>producers</em> rather than <em>consumers</em>, and for industry, integrity,
and piety, they will lose nothing in a comparison with the renowned
families of either the new or the old world.</p>

<p>The first of the family who emigrated to this country, of whom we
have any authentic record, came over from England 1633 to 1638.
Thomas, Jeremiah, and Barnabas, were among the early emigrants,
and old tradition says they were brothers. Thomas came over in the
"<i>Mary and John</i>," in 1633, settled permanently in Springfield, Mass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
Jeremiah also settled in Massachusetts. There was a John Horton in
New York, in 1645, but no one has been found claiming descent from
him. He probably returned to England.</p>

<p>It is not known from what place in England either Thomas or Jeremiah
came, nor is there any certain evidence that they were brothers
of Barnabas, but the three coming over about the same time would
favor the tradition that they were brothers.</p>

<p>The Head Quarters of Cæsar's army was near the present <em>Leicester</em>,
the principal town of that county, and the Horton name has been
known there to the remotest period of any authentic records. This
fact, together with the name itself, favors the idea that the family was
of Roman origin. The name in olden time was frequently written
Orton, and it is highly probable, that the Ortons and Hortons were
originally from the same family, and perhaps also the Nortons.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<h3>ANTIQUITY OF THE HORTON FAMILY.</h3>

<p>The antiquity of the Horton Family is established by the fact, that
one Robert De Horton, manumitted a bondman to his manor of
Horton, long before the time of Henry Larey, Earl of Lincoln, who
died in 1310. It is also ascertained that the Hortons had a manor-house
in Great Horton, with a mill and certain demesne lands therewith
belonging, at a very remote period.</p>

<p>William Horton, Esq., of Frith House, in Barksland, Halifax,
descended from the above-mentioned Robert, married Elizabeth,
daughter of Thomas Hanson, Esq., of Toothill, had issue and died
about 1640, viz.:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. William, of Barkisland, or Bark Island Hall, who purchased in the 15th of
Charles I., the estate of Howroyde, was born about 1576.</p>

<p>2. Joseph, born about 1578.&mdash;<cite>Burke's Landed Gentry, vol. 1, p. 345.</cite></p></div>

<p>It is held that this Joseph settled in Mousely, Leicester Co., and
was the father of Barnabas Horton. It is highly probable that Barnabas
was not the oldest son, and not inheriting real estate, may have
been one reason for his emigrating to America.</p>

<p>It is known that Capt. Jeremy Horton, 18 Aug., 1626, was the
master and owner of the ship "<i>Swallow</i>," of Barnstable, and that he
made voyages to New England, in 1633 and 1638, and in a subsequent
voyage he was shipwrecked and several lives lost&mdash;the crew and master
came to Boston, but the vessel was lost.</p>

<p>Capt. Roger Horton, about this time, had a prisoner delivered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
him, from the White Line Prison, to be transported into parts beyond
the seas, to serve in the wars of his majesty's plantations.</p>

<p>Tradition says that Barnabas Horton and family came over in the
"<i>Swallow</i>," in 1638, or perhaps earlier, but I have not found his
name on any of the lists of emigrants.</p>


<hr class="r10" />
<h3>ORIGINAL NAME OF SOUTHOLD.</h3>

<p>"The Indians called Southold,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> 'Yennycock.' Mr. John Youngs,
who had been a minister at Hingham, England, came over with a considerable
part of his church, and here fixed his residence. He gathered
his church anew on the 21 Oct., 1640, and the planters united themselves
with New Haven. However, they soon departed from the rule
of appointing none to office, or of admitting none to be freemen, but
members of the church. New Haven insisted on this as a fundamental
article of the constitution. They were, therefore, for a number
of years, obliged to conform to the law of jurisdiction. Some of
the principal men were: Rev. Mr. Youngs, Mr. William Wells, Mr.
Barnabas Horton, Thomas Mapes, John Tuthill, and Matthias Corwin."&mdash;<cite>Trumbull's

<h3><span class="smcap">Note.</span></h3>

<p>The reader will see at a glance the plan of this book. We commence
with the Christian name. Then follows the parentage, genealogical
data, &amp;c., and then the Christian names of the children and
order of births. In many of the early families the exact order of
births cannot be ascertained; but it has been approximated as nearly
as possible. The lineage is given in connection with the first member
of the family. The Roman numerals indicate the order of births.
The sons and daughters of the old Puritan, Barnabas, constitute the
second generation, but they are spoken by way of eminence as Joseph
I., Hannah I., &amp;c. The book contains much repetition, but none
too much to make it plain and easy to study.</p>

<p>This little book contains the chronicles of only about one-half of
the Horton families looked up. Those whose genealogical data are
given only in a small part, and those whose correct lineage has not
been satisfactorily ascertained, are not included in this book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span></p>

<p>This book is mainly what those who have kindly furnished records
and sketches have made it. The whole has been carefully compiled.
But genealogical works, almost of necessity, contain many errors.
Doubtless this small work has its full share. But when errors are discovered,
notice thereof should be given, so that a second edition may
be made entirely truthful. Thankful to all who have generously given
their assistance, this work is sent out as a small contribution to the
genealogical literature of the day, and in the hope that a more full
and extensive book of Horton chronicles may be issued at no very
distant day.</p>

<p><a name="Bn-JOSEPH_I" id="Bn-JOSEPH_I"></a>
I. <span class="smcap">Joseph</span>, the first son of <a href="#ROOT_BARNABAS_HORTON">Barnabas I.</a>, was born in Mousely, England;
exact date of his birth has not been found. Probably 1635. He came
to this country with his father. He married, about 1655, <span class="smcap">Jane Budd</span>,
daughter of John Budd, one of the original thirteen Puritans, who settled
in Southold in 1640. He resided near his father in Southold for
several years after his marriage; but about the year 1664, he moved
to Rye, Westchester County, New York, to which place his father-in-law,
John Budd, had previously gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>He was admitted a freeman of Connecticut Colony in 1662. In
1663 he witnessed a deed of Tucker and Brush to Mapes. He sold his
house, and lot of four acres of land, to his father, Barnabas Horton,
and also deeded land to John Youngs, in 1665. In 1671 he was chosen
one of the Selectmen of Rye, and about this time he is one of a Committee
of three to procure a minister. In 1678 he was a Justice of the
Peace, and about this time he was a Lieutenant, and then a Captain of
a Militia Company, and also authorized by the General Court to issue
warrants, and to unite persons in holy matrimony. In 1690-'91 he
was devisee of his brother Benjamin, and his brother Joshua was executor.
In 1695 he was chosen one of the vestrymen of the church, and
in 1699 he was licensed to keep a public house of entertainment. In
addition to all these dignities, he also filled the office of miller, and in
this useful calling he was succeeded by several of his descendants. He
had five sons and several daughters, only one of whom is mentioned.

VIII. <span class="smcap">Hon. William</span>, son of <a href="#Dv-DANIEL_III">Daniel Horton and Esther Lane</a>, born
at Yorktown, 10 January, 1743. In 1768, he married <span class="smcap">Lizzie (Elizabeth)
Covert</span>, an accomplished and amiable lady of French descent,
who was born 9 January, 1743. He removed from the town of
Sommers, formerly Stephentown, to Colchester, Delaware Co., N. Y.,
in 1789. He was a tanner and currier by trade, and he tanned the
first leather that was ever manufactured in Delaware Co. He purchased
large tracts of lands, built saw-mills and grist-mills, and carried
on a large business in the manufacture and sale of lumber and provisions,
as well as of leather. He was a healthy, muscular man. His father
died when he was sixteen, and he then for a while lived with his
brother Stephen. He was a man of sound judgment, and capable of
enduring much hardship. Colchester was an unbroken wilderness
when he settled there, but by his influence and great business capacity,
it was soon settled by an enterprising and industrious people, and the
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'wildness was soon'">wilderness was soon</ins> turned into well cultivated and productive fields.
He was a very prominent citizen among them. He was a Justice of
the Peace for many years, and in 1794, he was sent to the Legislature,
and about this time he was President Judge of Ulster Co., Ulster and
Delaware being then one county.</p>

<p>He and his wife were both worthy and active members of the Baptist
Church, and they trained up their children to fear the Lord and keep
his commandments. He died suddenly in 1831, at the age of eighty-eight
years, respected and lamented, not only by his numerous friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and relatives, but by the whole community. His wife survived him
but two weeks. Children all born in Sommers:</p>

a coward, and this he would not stand, and then the seconds were
chosen, and the fight began, Horton came off victorious, the Boston
man being so severely handled that it was several weeks before he was

III. <span class="smcap">James</span>, son of Hon. <a href="#Dn-WILLIAM_IV">William Horton and Lizzie Covert</a>, born
at Sommers, New York, 23 January, 1773; was married 15 May, 1800,

<p>He was about sixteen years of age when his father moved to Colchester,
Delaware County, New York, where he endured the hardships
and privations incident to a frontier settlement. In 1806 he
moved from Colchester to Chaumont, Jefferson Co., New York, then
a dense forest. He settled permanently on Point Salubrious, being
the first family of white people who ever settled there. Here he was
again exposed to hardships, causing continued ill health, until his
death, which occurred on 5th November, 1833. He and his wife were
members of the Baptist Church. He was a warm supporter of religion
and a lover of good order in society, which he always labored zealously
and successfully to promote. He was temperate in his habits and exemplary
in his character. He never disgraced the name he bore, and
his virtues are worthy of imitation by all his posterity. He and his
elder brother Henry settled near each other on Point Salubrious,
which is a neck of land running out about four miles into Chamount
Bay. Here they took up farms, had fine fishing grounds, and raised
large families.&mdash;<cite>Letter of Van Rantz Horton.</cite></p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"Isaac Horton moved from Colchester to Liberty, Sullivan Co.,
N. Y., 4 and 5 of April, 1826. The snow fell in April, after they
moved, about two feet deep. He had a large stock of cows, sheep and
hogs. In his flock of sheep were twenty-two ewes, the finest that could be
found in Colchester, nearly all of them only two years old. He drove
them to Liberty. Wolves were seen on the way near Parkesville.
He arrived at Liberty Falls&mdash;salted his sheep in the evening. The
next morning the sheep were gone, and Isaac and his son Roy, went
up the hill at Liberty Falls to look for them. Before they got beyond
the clearing they found dead sheep scattered along the log fence, and
others dying. Nearly all the flock were killed. They even killed a
lamb in the pen adjoining the house.</p>

<p>"In 1837, Isaac Horton had thirty-seven grandchildren, all living
but two. His children all lived to maturity."&mdash;(<cite>Letter G. B. Horton,
1871.</cite>)</p></div>

<p>Isaac Horton was a member of the Baptist Church, of Colchester;
but after he moved to Liberty, Sullivan Co., N. Y., he usually attended
the Episcopal Church. He built a grist-mill at Liberty Falls, in
1827 or 1828, another in 1841&ndash;42. He was quite extensively engaged
in the manufacture of bed-posts and other turned work, including
wooden bowls; also in shipping curled and birds-eye maple. Politically
he was a whig, and an ardent supporter of Clay and Webster.
He died 10 May, 1855. She is still living.</p>

<p>Under date of 8 February, 1874, Webb Horton writes, "My mother
is living and in good health. She resides at Liberty, Sullivan Co.,
N. Y. She is in the eighty-seventh year of her age. Her father died
aged eighty-eight, and her grandmother, Prudence Schofield, aged
ninety-four. She has now living ten children, thirty-seven grandchildren,
and nineteen great-grandchildren."</p>

<p>This is a very remarkable family&mdash;so large and yet so few deaths.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
It is a rare occurrence to find a family of children, ten in number, the
youngest forty-six years old, <em>all living</em>. And then so many grandchildren
and great-grandchildren living. I have no record of any
family equal to it, and doubtless, the number is now (1875), somewhat
augmented.</p>

<p>Hon. Frost Horton is a retired manufacturer, and resides at Peekskill.
He has always been a prominent man in the community, enjoying
in a high degree the confidence and respect of his fellow citizens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
He possesses fine social qualities, and, since retiring from business, he
occasionally amuses himself in hunting and fishing. His integrity,
industry and great business capacities, during the active part of his
life, rendered him a most valuable acquisition to the community in
which he carried on his business, and the articles he manufactured
were of sterling value to the farming interests of the country.</p>

<p>Mr. Horton, on sending me his photograph for an engraving,
accompanied it with the following very modest and unassuming sketch
of his life:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"I was born in Yorktown, Westchester County, New York, 15
September, 1806. My parents were farmers, in moderate circumstances.
I remained with them until I was seventeen, working on the
farm in the summer, and going to school in the winter, thus acquiring
merely a common-school education. When I was seventeen years old,
at the suggestion of my parents, I decided to learn the blacksmith
trade, and commenced the business at once, and served an apprenticeship
for several years. On the 17th of October, 1827, I married
Phebe Tompkins, and on the 9th of March, 1820, we moved to Peekskill
village, where we have resided ever since. I bought some property,
and set up the blacksmithing business. I succeeded well in the
business. In the spring of 1835 I entered into a co-partnership business
with Mr. Truman Minor, under the firm name of 'Minor &amp; Horton,'
and went into the foundry business, manufacturing agricultural
implements, principally ploughs and plough-castings. Our business
increased rapidly, and paid us well. We continued partners for
twenty years. In 1855 Mr. Minor retired from business, and I took
in Mr. Geo. W. Depeu as a partner, and about two years afterwards,
we admitted each of us a son, and the firm then became, 'Horton,
Depeu &amp; Sons.' Our manufactured articles were sold in nearly every
State in the Union, and also in many foreign countries.</p>

<p>"In 1862 we all sold out to a stock company, formed for that purpose.
Having been in active business for thirty years, I now retired.
In the spring of 1855 I was elected Supervisor of the town of Cortlandt,
and I represented that town in the Board of Supervisors for five
years in succession.</p>

<p>"In the winter of 1858, I was a member of the Legislature from
this Assembly District. For many years I held the various offices of
our village, but of late have declined official stations, preferring the
enjoyments of private life."</p></div>

<p>Mr. Horton is not a public professor of Christianity, but is a gentleman
of correct moral deportment, and very temperate in his habits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Mrs. Horton is an amiable lady, and a valued member of the Presbyterian
Church.</p>

<p>The following auto-biographical sketch of Dea. John W. Horton,
contained in one of his letters, is interesting and well worth preserving:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"I was born in the town of Colchester, Delaware County, New
York, on the 12th of October, 1802. When a little over three years
old, my father moved to Lyme, Jefferson County, New York, which
was then known as the Black River Country, and settled on the shore
of Chaumont Bay, at the east end of Lake Ontario. It was here I spent
my childhood and my boyhood days, learning, as I grew up, how to
endure the privations of a pioneer life in a northern wilderness. At
the age of nine years I began to know what manual labor meant,
working on the farm in the summer, and going to school in the winter.
In those days our school-houses were frequently some old log
house, which some settler had built and then vacated, and perhaps
left the country, or moved into better quarters. Such school-houses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>were splendid for hot weather, being so well ventilated; but in the
winter they required piles of wood and great physical endurance to
keep warm. My facilities for acquiring an education were exceedingly
limited. Being the eldest of eight children, perhaps I had to take a
little more of the rough end of life than some of the others.</p>

<p>"At the commencement of my seventeenth year, my father commenced
preparing for building a new house, and I then gave up going
to school, and worked through the winter at quarrying stone and getting
lumber for the new house. The house was commenced in the
spring and completed before fall, myself and younger brother carrying
the stone and mixing the mortar.</p>

<p>"I remained with my father until I was twenty-four years old. I
then went for myself. I purchased land, and settled permanently at
Adams Centre, after my marriage. In December, 1829, myself and
wife connected ourselves with the Baptist Church, at the State Road,
Jefferson County, New York.</p>

<p>"We were blessed with four daughters&mdash;all grew up to womanhood,
married, made a public profession of religion, and became members of
the Baptist Church. We occupied our old home until the 13th of
December, 1872, when death removed my dear wife from this world
of care, pain and suffering to the mansions of everlasting rest, as I
humbly trust.</p>

<p>"The next April I sold my farm, and I am now spending the few
remaining days of my life with my three surviving daughters, by
whose affectionate care and tenderness I am made quite contented and
happy."</p></div>

<p>"He was a good soldier; his kind and obliging disposition, and
his soldierly bearing won for him the respect and good-will of all who
knew him. His love for his country overrode all personal considerations,
and he was often heard to say, that the life of a civilian had no
attractions for him while armed traitors refused to acknowledge the
laws and its institutions typified by the Stars and Stripes. He loved
his friends and home, but he loved his country more, and he was willing
to bid adieu to father and mother, brothers and sisters, and go
into the foremost rank of those who were battling for the right, and
he battled nobly, and fell at last a martyr for his country's freedom.
He died in Millon Prison, Ga., aged 23 years and 10 months."&mdash;<cite>Extract

<p>Isaac S. Horton was a farmer, and occasionally a hunter, "frequently
taking his rifle," as he says, and going into the woods not far
from his house, he would knock down a deer or two and return home
by breakfast time. One morning in June, some forty years ago, he
took his gun and went out into the woods, about half a mile
from his house, when a fine buck appeared before him and down
he went. While reloading his gun he heard a wolf howl, and going a
little further he brought him down also. On returning to the place
where he shot the buck, behold, a huge panther had taken possession
of the buck, and was regaling himself by licking up the blood and preparing
to feast upon the carcass. He stood still for some minutes,
looking at the panther, thinking it rather cruel to kill him before he
had a chance to take his fill of his much coveted food. But at length
the panther saw him and showed signs of fight, and he then put a
ball through his brain. On going home for his team, he found he had
been gone only a little over an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. Horton took up land in a dense wilderness, several miles from
any inhabitant, cleared it up, and then bought several other farms and
assisted in clearing them up. He was a man of strong constitution,
and lived to a good old age, dying at his old homestead, about two
miles from Ghent meeting house, in Sheshequin, Pa.</p>

<p>"Our relatives are mainly in Southold, along the Hudson, in central and

one of the original brothers went into New Jersey, and that he had
lost all trace of him. May be <em>you</em> are a scion from that root. At any
rate, the Hortons are a great people. I see an account now and then
of some of them in the reports of criminal prosecutions, but these are
offset by now and then one in good and honorable places. The last
Governor of Michigan married a full-blooded Horton of our line.
Trace us back to the throne if you can, see that you make no less of
our great top root, when you find him than an Earl." Another Horton
says: "If you find any of the name claiming to have royal blood in
his veins, perform phlebotomy upon him at once, and take every drop
out of him or disown him. Trace us back to the noble old Roman

</div>

<p>Harry L. Horton's father was a well-to-do farmer, and Harry
remained with his parents and worked on the farm until he was seventeen
years old. He received but a moderate common-school education,
and, during his school-boy days, he was noted for his activity
and sagacity, and early exhibited more than ordinary business capacity.
At the age of seventeen he engaged as a clerk in the store of
D. Brink &amp; Son, at Horn Brook, Pa., and remained with them until
they sold out to H. W. Langford &amp; Co., and with them he continued
his clerkship until they closed business. Shortly after this, he was
engaged for one year by O. D. Bartlett, Esq., of Towanda, Pa., as
clerk in his store, and at the expiration of that time, he entered the
store of Joseph Powell &amp; Co., of Towanda, with whom he served as
clerk until 1854. He always gave good satisfaction to his employers.
Having by his industry and economy laid up a small sum of money,
he decided to go West, and leaving Bradford County in 1854, he traveled
extensively in Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin, until he neared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>the bottom of his purse, without locating or engaging in business anywhere.
But at length, in 1856, he went to Milwaukee, and engaged
in the produce commission business, in which he was very successful.
Here he seemed to be permanently settled. But after the death of his
wife, his business, which had been very remunerative, seemed to lose
much of its interest, and in March, 1865, having closed up his business
in Milwaukee, with about $15,000 in pocket, he went to New
York City, and immediately engaged in the banking and broker business,
in which he has continued until the present time, conducting a
large business, which, under the supervision of his keen eye and his
assiduous personal attention, he has made very lucrative. He now
owns a fine property on Staten Island, and, though he lost largely by
the panic of 1873, he is still doing a fair business, and, to use his own
language, he "has always managed to pay a hundred cents on the
dollar and never <em>failed</em>."</p>

<p>He possesses excellent social qualities, is kind-hearted, generous and
noble, and at his banking house, 56 Broadway, New York, or at his
island home, those who visit him will meet with such a frank and cordial
reception as to make them feel that they are not only at home,
but at the home of one whose words and deeds define the character of
a true gentleman.</p>

<p>Mr. Horton was married 2. in Trinity Chapel, N. Y., 12 October,
1875, by the Rev. Dr. Weston, to Sara Patten, a lady of culture and
refinement of the city of New York, and an esteemed member of the
Episcopal Church.</p>

I. <span class="smcap">Lieut. Israel</span>, son of <a href="#Jn-JONATHAN_III">Jonathan Horton and Elizabeth Goldsmith</a>
(<em>Jonathan</em>, <em>Caleb I.</em>), born at Cutchogue, about 1728; married in
1755, to <span class="smcap">Sarah Lee</span>, daughter of Rev. John Lee, of Lyme, Conn.,
born about 1730. The Rev. John Lee had two sons who were
preachers.</p>

<p>Israel and his family moved from Cutchogue to Goshen Township
in 1762. He was a farmer. In the Autumn of 1771, he went to
Newburgh with a load of grain. On the way home, he was taken sick,
succeeded in getting home, but died in a day or two after. About
1782, his widow married Parshall Terry, formerly of Southold. He
was a widower, was living with his family in Wyoming Valley in 1778.
He and his family were in the famed Forty Fort the night after the
Indian battle and massacre. The next morning they fled to the
mountains and after suffering great hardships, crossing the "big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
swamp," afterwards known as "Swamp Dismal," or the "Shades of
Death," they reached Stroudsburg, Pa., in safety. Leaving his family
here, he hastened to Orange Co., N. Y., for assistance. During his
absence his wife was taken sick with "camp distemper" (malignant
dysentery), and died leaving a large family of children, the youngest
but three years old.</p>

<p>He took his family to Little Britain, Orange Co., N. Y., and as
above-stated, married the widow Horton. The two families, all told,
numbering twenty-two persons. The house in which they lived being
an old-fashioned double log-house, they hired a school-master and
made one part of it a school-house, thus evincing a laudable determination
to have the education of their household properly cared for.
The writer obtained these facts in 1828, from Benjamin Horton, son
of Israel, who was one of the pupils. But this arrangement was not of
long continuance, for in 1786, Sarah, the mother and step-mother
died, and was buried by her first husband in Warwick Cemetery.</p>

Terry</span>, daughter of Uriah Terry and Abigail Cleveland, and born in

in Chester, and then settled for a short time at Boskenridge,&mdash;it
is now Basking Ridge,&mdash;New Jersey, and then moved
to Somerville, New Jersey, where he settled permanently and
where he died. He was one of the most pious and exemplary
men that ever lived, a zealous, active, intelligent Presbyterian.
He was a very strict observer of the Sabbath, and violation of it
by his neighbors always gave him great displeasure. Observing one
of his neighbors frequently chopping firewood on the Sabbath, he
went one Saturday afternoon and took his neighbor a load of wood prepared
for the fire, telling him it was to save him the trouble of chopping
his firewood on the Sabbath. His neighbor took it kindly, and
was careful afterwards to see that his fuel was all ready beforehand for
the Sabbath. It was a common remark of one of the most reckless
men of Somerville, that "If all professors of religion would live like
Old Jason Horton, he would believe there was some reality in religion."</p>

<p>Jason Horton never failed to exert a strong influence for the Christian
religion as long as he lived. And his wife also was a true help-meet
for him in this regard, possessing genuine piety and Christian
activity. She died at Somerville, on Sabbath morning at 5 o'clock,
22 Aug., 1841.</p>

She was the tender and affectionate mother of eleven children, and
raised them all to maturity. They moved to Wyoming Valley in

and settled permanently, and where he died on the 28th day of April,

<p>Major Horton built the first framed dwelling-house on the west side of
the river in the township of then Wyalusing, now Terry. He was the
owner of the first two-horse wagon ever brought into Terrytown, and
that wagon not only cheerfully bore the burdens he put upon it, but
also those of several of the neighbors. He also owned the first fanning
mill ever brought into the place. He built the first frame barn that
was ever built in the township. It was built in 1805, and is still in a
good state of preservation, and is owned by Edmund Horton.</p>

<p>The framed house mentioned above, built by Major Horton in 1806,
accidentally took fire on the 23 Sept., 1861, and was burned up.
Major Horton was a wagoner in the Revolutionary War, towards the
close of the war, and was stationed in Mamakating Hollow, and afterwards
on the Neversink Creek, not far from the present Port Jervis. He
was Major of a battalion of militia in Wyalusing, frequently held township
offices, and was one of the leading men of the place. He was not
a public professor of Christianity, but his life in the main was in harmony
with its teachings, and he loved, and was successful, in promoting
good order in society. He was universally esteemed, and at his
funeral a larger concourse of people were gathered than had ever before
been witnessed in this part of the country on a funeral occasion. Deborah,
his wife, was a woman distinguished for her eminent piety,
unwearied industry, and good economy; she knew well how to guide
the house. Their children were all born at Terrytown, except Ebenezer,
who was born in Little Britain, N. Y., and Anna and Lydia,
who were born in Wyoming Valley.</p>

breath. His end was peace.</p>

appeared in the Presbyterian, of Philadelphia, shortly after his decease:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"Mr. Horton has been for forty years the indefatigable and successful
Tract Missionary of the Seventh Ward, New York City. When he
first assumed the important task of laboring for the spiritual interests of
this portion of the city, it was known as one of the most wicked and
wretched wards. The 'Sailor Boarding-houses' of olden times, with
their numerous 'land-sharks,' and temptations to sinful indulgence,
swarmed here.... In process of time, the greater part of this territory
was occupied by dwellings of opulent merchants. Then after
another period of years, a new generation found the older inhabitants
of the Seventh Ward crowded out, and their former homes became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
filled with a population of the dregs of old country emigrants, or gave
place to shops and manufactories. Mr. Horton adapted himself and
modified his work to meet these successive changes, and calling to his
help a faithful band of distributors, teachers and visitors, made a
Christian influence to be felt, increasing its power by every available
means. A great multitude of conversions from year to year were the
result of his faithful labors. Admonished by the approach of old age,
he resigned his position as missionary, made all arrangements as to his
worldly affairs, wrote farewell letters, and quietly looked forward to
the close of his earthly career."</p></div>

<p>Hiram Horton possessed fine social qualities, was well skilled in
music, and always led the singing in the Congregational Church until
prevented by the infirmities incident to old age.</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"With the most limited opportunities for early education, he became
a great and profound thinker. He was an upright and conscientious
man, and largely shared the esteem of all who knew him. He was
a most sincere and ardent Universalist, living the life of the Christian,
and dying in the full and perfect triumph of Gospel faith and hope.
He and his wife were, for many years, members of the Congregational
Church of Chester; but about thirty years before his death, he
and his wife embraced Universalism, and avowed it openly ever
afterwards. Nevertheless, they continued to support the church and
worship within its walls, and we hazard nothing in saying that there
was no man in Chester, nor in all the region round about it, who was
more generally and highly respected for manly and Christian character
than Hiram Horton. Some time before his death he had requested
that a minister of the Universalist denomination should attend his
funeral services; but the pastor of the church, the Rev. Luke I. Stoutenberg,
and others, refused to let them into the church, notwithstanding
that the salary of that preacher was paid in part by the 'Horton
Fund,' and the church itself had been built mainly by the Hortons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>

kind-hearted and upright man, a close figurer, but always just and
honorable in his dealings. He was never married, never made
a public profession of religion, although he was a man of very correct
moral deportment and habits, and practically a Christian gentleman.
On the 29 Oct., 1871, as he was riding with a friend in a buggy, the
horse became frightened, and ran away, upsetting the wagon, and
throwing Mr. Horton upon the ground with great violence, causing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>

of nephews and nieces to inherit it.</p>

<p>Maj. Horton possessed more than an ordinary fund of cheerfulness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
joviality; and his humorous and genial nature was an unfailing source
of interest and life in the family and in the social circle. He was a
careful business man. Though long engaged in mercantile pursuits,
he never had occasion to fear financial crises or revulsions, living always
prepared at any moment to honor his pecuniary obligations.
Punctuality and promptness were marked characteristics of the man.
To perform was more pleasing to him than to promise; in enterprises
for the public good he was always among the first. He was constable
for many years, Justice of the Peace for five years, and declined a re-election;
was Treasurer of the County for two years, and was one of
the electors on the Democratic electoral ticket in 1848. He was Captain
and then Major in the militia, and from 1828 to 1835 Brigade Inspector.</p>

<p>Though not a public professor of Christianity, he was its friend and
supporter, and conscientiously and habitually practised its virtues. He
was uniformly in attendance upon public worship, and paid more
money for the Terrytown Tabernacle (Union meeting-house) than any
other person.</p>

<p>He was popular and pleasing in his manners, and politically a man
of mark, but never a <em>politician</em>&mdash;holding office only when the office
sought him. His end was quiet and peaceful.</p>

V. <span class="smcap">Eunice</span>, daughter of Maj. <a href="#Is-JOHN_V">John Horton and Deborah Terry</a>,
born at Terrytown, 14 Jan., 1796; married in the old log meeting-house
at Merry All, Pa., 20 July, 1817, by Rev. Minor Manasseh York,
to <span class="smcap">Thomas Ingham, Esq.</span>, son of Joseph Ingham and Pamelia Ellicott,
and born in Bucks Co., Pa., 1 April, 1794. The ancestors of Thomas
Ingham came from England. Jonas Ingham, the first known ancestor,
came to this country about A. D. 1700. By trade he was a clothier.
He married a Cheshire woman, who often told her grandson that she
landed on the ground where the city of Philadelphia now stands before
there was a house on it. They settled in Trenton, N. J., where their
son Jonathan was born, in 1709 or 1710. They also had three daughters.
Jonathan Ingham resided in Bucks County, at a place known as
Ingham's Springs, where he owned a farm and woolen factory. He
was a rigid Quaker. A cotemporary, who was well acquainted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
him said, "He did not belong to the old aristocracy who governed
Bucks County before the Revolution, but his position in life and high
intelligence put him in their society." They made him a Justice of the
Peace, a Judge of the Court, and a member of the Assembly. He died in
1798 or 1799, aged 89. He had 3 sons and 2 daughters. Jonas, his youngest
son, was born in 1746. He learned the business of a clothier. January
3, 1771, he was married to Elizabeth Beaumont, and soon after leased his
father's fulling mill, and was running it when the Revolutionary war
commenced. When the contesting armies came near, he enlisted, and
served first as a Lieutenant and then as a Captain in the militia. He
was in service in 1777, and in the battle at Gulf Mills. In the early
part of the year 1778 he was taken with a fever and sent home. He
afterward purchased land and built a fulling mill near the Delaware
River; he there lived some years and educated his children himself.
In 1789 he commenced a settlement on the Wyalusing Creek, being
the first settler above Lewis', on that stream. He was an ingenious
mechanic, and invented the machine for shearing cloth, which afterwards
came into general use. He was a good writer and public
speaker. In 1804 he was elected a member of the Legislature from
Luzerne County. He died October 28, 1820. He had three sons and
three daughters.</p>

<p>Joseph, his eldest son, was born January 21, 1773, and his father
taught him the common branches of education, including surveying
and algebra. While his father was making his first improvements on
the Wyalusing, Joseph remained at home in Bucks County, in charge
of the business. He learned the trade of a millwright. About the
year 1793 he married Pamelia Ellicott, and soon after bought three
hundred acres of land on the Susquehanna River, at the mouth of the
Sugar Run. He moved his family to this place in 1795, and commenced
building a saw mill in the fall of 1801, and finished it in the
spring following. Soon afterwards he built a grist mill. His wife,
Pamelia Ellicott, died 17 November, 1824. He afterwards married
Laura (Whitcomb) Vose, a widow, by whom he had two sons. He
had six sons by his first wife&mdash;no daughters. He died 11 June, 1829.
Thomas, his eldest son, was educated partly by his father at home and
partly in the common-school at Wyalusing. He learned his father's
business of millwright, running mills and farming. He bought a farm
and settled first at Browntown, Pa. But he remained there but a short
time, when he sold out and came back to Sugar Run, and lived near
his father. After the death of his father, he bought the homestead,
and there lived until his death. He re-built the mills, and also erected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>a store-house, and engaged in the mercantile business. While quite a
young man he was appointed a Justice of the Peace, and held that
office during the most of his life. His mind was well informed on all
general topics; his judgment was excellent, and he was noted for his
morality, honesty and truthfulness. He was mild and quiet in his manners,
but decided and firm in his purposes. Eunice, his wife, was
handsome in her appearance and pleasing in her manners, possessed a
lively and cheerful disposition, and was exceedingly energetic. She
managed all the affairs of her household with economy and skill, and
often assisted her husband in his business. When he was absent
she could as readily manage the business out-doors as in the house.
She was remarkably generous, and always had a bountiful hand for the
poor, and was active in assisting her neighbors who were in sickness or
trouble. Without making a public profession, both she and her husband
exhibited the virtues of Christianity in her daily walk and character.
She died 2 March, 1844. He died 14 August, 1855. They
were both buried in the Terrytown Cemetery.</p>

son of John Morrow and Nancy Gamble, and born in Dunlevey, in the
Parish of Aughobog, County of Monohan, Ireland, 20 June, 1801.
He sailed from Ireland 14 March, 1811, and landed at Amboy, on 15
April, 1811. He was an excellent farmer, owned a good farm in
"The Bend" Asylum, now Wilmot Township, Bradford County, Pa.
He was engaged in early life in merchandising, and later in life in
raising and selling stock and grain. He possessed good business capacities,
and was a man of much influence and activity, of good, sound,
moral character, and well read in the sacred Scriptures, and in sentiment
a thorough Old School Presbyterian or Covenanter, but never
made a public profession. He was fond of company, and always took
pains to make pleasant visits for his friends when they called on him.</p>

<p>Sally was a good housekeeper&mdash;industrious, economizing and a skillful
worker, often taking the premium at the County Fair for domestic
articles of her own manufacture. She possessed a wonderfully retentive
memory&mdash;readily stating, not only incidents that occurred at any time
during her life, but also dates&mdash;dates of births, marriages and deaths
of all her acquaintances, even from her early childhood. She had a
peculiar faculty of stating a fact or circumstance so connected with
others as to leave no doubt of its truthfulness. She died in Wyalusing,
27 April, 1874, leaving to her family and friends the consoling
belief that she exchanged the cares and sorrows of this mortal life for
the full fruition of that world</p>

was erected on the corner of his farm, and it has always been known
as the "Horton Methodist Church." He was Captain of the first
volunteer militia company ever organized in that section of the
country. He was always a true republican, and frequently received
the nomination of the Whig party for a seat in the Legislature, but in
consequence of the large Democratic majority in the district, he was
never elected. With a character unblemished he has lived to an honorable

<p>Hon. Elijah Horton's present residence is Oswego, Kosciusko Co.,

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"You ask
for a short biographical sketch. This I rather decline, further than
to say that my life has been devoted to the judicial profession. I
studied law in Morristown, N. J., and practiced there until I removed
to Alleghany Co., N. Y., in 1832. I served as first Judge of the
Court of Common Pleas of that county for about ten years. Soon
after moving into the State of Indiana in 1844, I was appointed District
Judge, and I have served in that office, and also as a Justice of
the Peace ever since, until within a few weeks past when I resigned.
In looking over my past life, I see many things that I would not do
over again, with my past experience, especially would I say long and
loud, <span class="smcap">No</span>, instead of <span class="smcap">Yes</span>, as I often did. Your letter brings to my
mind views and opinions which I have been learning and experiencing
for many years of my past life. Habits have grown upon me imperceptibly
from my childhood. I have old diaries written in my
younger days, in which I find recorded rules for my own conduct, the
strict observance of which, has caused me many miles of travel and
hours of labor. For illustration, I recall one or two: 'Have a place
for everything, and keep everything in its place' and 'Never put off
till to morrow what you can as well do to-day.' I began life under
such rules, and I have always been tyrannically <em>ruled</em> by them. If I
forgot to do anything that I intended to do through the day, and happened
to think of it after I had gone to bed, I could not sleep until I
would get up and do it, if possible, and if not possible there would be
no sleep for me that night. I have written this letter at one sitting
and feel pretty tired."</p></div>

<p>The letter contained about four pages foolscap,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and it is no wonder that he, now just entering his eightieth year, should
feel tired. The greater wonder is that he could write at all. It is
written in a bold, plain hand, giving no indications of age.</p>

was a merchant. He and his wife Fannie Moore, to whom he was married 2 May,
1872; went South early in the Summer of 1873. She came North by the advice of
physicians, and at her husband's request, as it was not considered safe for her to
remain there during the hot season. His mother writes: "We have passed through
a great bereavement. Howell died the 18 Sept. last. He was taken sick on Sabbath
with yellow fever, and died the next Thursday, at eleven o'clock. Our hopes as to
this world are all blasted, but we trust that he is with his Saviour, to whom he gave
himself in his seventeenth year, and from that time until his death, he lived a
Christian. So we may mourn not without hope."</p></div>

<p>The Colonel resides at the old homestead of his father, Col. Nathan,
owns good lands, and is an excellent farmer. He lost heavily by
Emancipation. He has been a very prominent man all his life&mdash;firm,
intelligent and generous. He was elected to the State Legislature in

North Carolina, on the Henry Clay ticket, in 1844. He was again
elected to the State Legislature from Watauga County, in 1854. He
was a volunteer in the service of the Confederate States, in 1861, and
was elected Captain of Co. B., 37th Regiment North Carolina troops,
infantry, and he was in the seven days' fight near Richmond, Va., towards
the close of which the command of the regiment devolved on
him. Soon after this, health failing, he resigned and came home, and
in 1864 he was elected to the State Senate. He says, and no doubt
truly, that his house was robbed, in the spring of 1865, eighteen times
in fourteen days, by men professing to be, and wearing the garb of,
Union soldiers.</p>

<p>Silas H. Stringham entered the navy in June, 1810, as midshipman
on the frigate <i>President</i>, Commodore John Rogers. In 1812 he was
assigned to the <i>Guererre</i>, under Decatur. In 1813 he was on the
<i>Spark</i>, one of the Algerine squadron. In 1817, having been promoted
to a Lieutenancy, he was transferred to the sloop-of-war <i>Erie</i>, and in
1818, to the <i>Peacock</i>. He was next ordered to the sloop-of-war <i>Cyane</i>,
in 1819. In 1821 he was upon the <i>Hornet</i>, 1st Lieutenant, at the West
India station. In 1822 he was again on the <i>Cyane</i>, under Com.
Creighton. From 1825 to 1829 he held a position at the Brooklyn
Navy Yard, and in 1829 he was again assigned to the <i>Peacock</i>, and
sent in search of the <i>Hornet</i>, sloop-of-war, which was lost. We next
find him on the <i>Falmouth</i>, and ordered to Carthagena. From 1830
to 1834 he was in shore service. In 1835 he has command of the
<i>John Adams</i>, in the Mediterranean squadron. In 1837 he is second
in command at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and from 1843 to 1846 he
had the full command of this yard. During the Mexican war
we find him in active service, and in command of the <i>Ohio</i>, ship-of-the-line.
In 1851 he was commander of the Norfolk Navy Yard; and
in 1852 assigned to the command of the Mediterranean squadron,
which he held till 1855. He is next in command of the Charleston
Navy Yard, which he held till May, 1859. In March, 1861, he was a
member of a naval Court-martial, and while there was appointed flag
officer of the Atlantic Blockade squadron. In 1861 Com. Stringham
was honored with the preparation of the first of those combined naval
and military expeditions which have crowned the American navy with
such glory; and in his case, as in many others, the success has been
almost exclusively due to the action of the navy. The result of this
expedition being the capture of the rebel forts Clark and Hatteras, and
the surrender of the garrison to Flag-officer Stringham and General
Butler, consisting of 715 men, 1000 stand of arms, 75 kegs of powder,
5 stand of colors, 31 cannon (1 of them a 10-inch Columbiad), a brig
loaded with cotton, a sloop with provisions and stores, 2 light-boats,
150 bags of coffee, &amp;c. Not a man belonging to the fleet was killed.
For this brilliant affair Flag-officer Stringham received the thanks of
the Government.</p>

<p>On the 23d of September, 1861, at his own request, he was relieved
from his command, and in August, 1862, he was made a Rear-Admiral,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
on the retired list, and soon after this he was President of the Naval
Commission to locate a new Navy Yard. In 1863 he had command of
the Navy Yard and station at Charleston, S. C., remained there till
1866. In 1869 he was Port Admiral at New York, and served three
years. March 3d, 1873, by Act of Congress, retired officers are prohibited
from being employed by Government, except in time of war.
Since that time the Admiral is permitted to enjoy a retired life, at his
residence, in Brooklyn, N. Y.</p>

Oct., 1791; married <span class="smcap">Sally Moore</span>, a lineal descendant of Thomas

<p>"He early engaged in the business of transporting Orange County
products to New York, and soon found himself in command of a first-class
sloop, of extra heavy tonnage, and his carrying trade of merchandise,
passengers, &amp;c., became very extensive. The immense traffic
at White Hall Street, East River, prompted Captain Vail to seek some
other quarters, more commodious than that he occupied&mdash;the city at
that time having a population of only about 100,000. He soon found
an old acquaintance, formerly a Miss Horton, of West Chester Co.,
N. Y., who had married Mr. James Van Nostrand, a wholesale grocer.
An arrangement was soon consummated, by which Van Nostrand was
to move his stock to West Street, and Vail to leave East River and
land at the Albany Basin, adjacent to Van Nostrand's store, which
arrangement was at once announced to the Hudson River boatmen at
White Hall, when, in derision, they laughed at the young Captain's
presumption; but Vail and Van Nostrand soon had the laugh on the
White Hall advocates, for the entire craft from Orange County soon
followed Capt. Vail, discharging regularly his heavy loads of produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
from the <i>Bayard</i>,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the first to establish a regular wharf for Orange
County produce and passengers on the North River side of New York,
and Van Nostrand's grocery was the first ever located in West Street.
The following summer Capt. Vail's eyesight became impaired, and he
moved to Goshen, New York, where he and Mrs. Vail were popular
hotel keepers until the year 1834, when he was elected Clerk of Orange
County, and re-elected in 1837, and again in 1840. In 1832 he established
at Goshen a Baptist periodical, called the <cite>Signs of the Times</cite>,
which is still in existence, and edited and published at Middletown,
New York, by Elder Beebe, the venerable Old-School Baptist preacher.
He, also, in 1844, established in Goshen the <cite>Clarion</cite>, the first Free-Soil
newspaper ever established in this part of the State of New York.
His religious and political opinions were regarded as <em>ultra</em> or <em>radical</em>,
and he was a recognized leader of his sect or party. His general
urbanity and good judgment, and his enthusiastic nature, combined
with his fine appreciation of the arts, made him popular with all classes
of people. He died in Goshen.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Vail survived him over a quarter of a century. She was devotedly
attached to him and his children. She was a beautiful woman,
and her happiness seemed to centre in their welfare, which her husband
reciprocated by leaving her his entire estate, which she left unimpaired
at her death, after a life of over four-score years. Their youngest
daughter is the well known Madame Martinez, the eminent soprano
vocalist and teacher of the voice."</p></div>

<p>Nathaniel Coe was an honest lawyer and an upright politician. He
possessed a superior intellect, and always commanded the respect and
esteem of his fellow men. He was long a magistrate, and for four years
in succession he represented Livingston and Alleghany Counties in the
Legislature of the State of New York. He was often an arbitrator,
both in the Church and out of it. In religion he was what was then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
called, by way of reproach, a <em>radical</em>. In 1829 he went to Nevada.
In 1851 he was appointed U. S. Mail Agent for Oregon. He finally
settled at Hood River, where, on the 10th Oct., 1868, he died. For
several years before his death, he carried on an extensive business in
raising fruit, and became quite rich. He was a thoroughly anti-slavery
man, and while the Liberty party was in existence, he was its firm and
warm supporter. Mrs. Coe resides at Hood River, and her son Charles,
who was a superior young man, noted for his piety and sound moral
and Christian character, carried on successfully his father's business
until his death, which occurred 24 Dec., 1874. His mother said of
him, "My heart's beloved has left me, nothing can fill the void. He
not only filled his father's place on the farm, but also at the family
altar, and notwithstanding his youth, older men came to him for advice
on matters temporal as well as religious."</p>

<p>Mrs. Coe is an educated, refined and talented Christian lady&mdash;an
able and finished writer, and the author of many very pretty verses
and poems, and though aged, and having suffered much from ill
health, yet her penmanship is neat, and her thoughts and words fresh,
warm and vigorous. Speaking of her deceased little infant, Susan
Amelia, she says, "To whom, like a dew-drop, kissed off by the sun's
morning beam, a beauteous existence was given, whose soul seemed to
come down to earth in a dream, only to wake up when it ascended to
Heaven." She has kindly given much valuable information in regard
to the Hortons of New Jersey and their connections, only a small part
of which can appear in the "Chronicles." Mrs. Coe's ancestors, both
on her father and mother's side, were originally from England.</p>

<p>"So far as my knowledge extends, the Hortons as a family have not
been renowned for their attainments in literature, in the fine arts, or in
natural science; not distinguished as warriors or statesmen, or in the
learned professions. Indeed they have not been celebrated for great
heroic achievements of any kind. Nevertheless, with but few exceptions,
they have been industrious, peaceable, law-abiding, and very
respectable citizens, possessing commendable self-reliance and independence.
They belong to the middle class of the people&mdash;the class
which has always constituted the basis of a good-ordered, well-regulated,
and prosperous State and Nation. Let their merits and their virtues
be inscribed on the tablets of our memories, and preserved for our
veneration and emulation."&mdash;<cite>Letter of Harrison Faulkner Horton,

sickness would prove fatal, he said, "Oh dear, I wish it would not be so long," and
then added, "Methusalah only lived 969 years." At another time, when his father
was fixing the pillow under his head, he said, "I would rather have a stone for my
pillow, for Jacob, when he had a stone for his pillow, saw a ladder whose top reached
to Heaven, and the Angels of God ascending and descending upon it." Just before
he died he repeated the Lord's prayer, and then said, "I am ready to die and go to
Heaven," and in a solemn tone, added, "I go down into deep water," and soon
after, in a cheerful tone, exclaimed, "but I got into the Ark." On the evening of
the third day of his sickness, without a struggle or a groan, "He neared the tide,&mdash;sunk

<p>In boyhood Joseph possessed a person of rare physical beauty,
and evinced a bright and happy disposition. He was frank spoken,
open, genial and social. His native industry, all through his childhood
and youth, displayed great aptitude for business. In all these
respects, as was the boy so is the man.</p>

<p>After availing himself of the schools of his native town, in his 16th
year he entered upon the English and the commercial courses of study,
in the Susquehanna Collegiate Institute, at Towanda, remaining there
through 1858 and 1859. He then continued as an efficient clerk in
his father's store until August, 1862.</p>

<p>The war for the Union had burst upon the nation. His heart was
ablaze with enthusiasm for the Constitution and the Union. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
father was proud of the valor and patriotism of his young son. Joseph
had become as his right hand, and was his main-stay in business. The
fond father hesitated to spare a son so dear to his heart, and so essential
to the success of his affairs. At length, like tens of thousands of
other fathers, he made the sacrifice for his country, consented, and
allowed Joseph to enlist on the 7th of August, 1862, at Wyalusing,
under Captain George W. Jackson, in Company "A," of the 141st
Regiment of Pennsylvania Volunteers. Joseph was a week afterwards
(August 14th,) elected 1st Lieutenant of this Company.</p>

<p>In September his Regiment was assigned to the 1st Brigade of Birney's
(formerly Kearney's) Division in the 3d Army Corps. It was
almost immediately put into most active service. Five days after his
first battle (that of Fredericksburg,) Lieut. Horton was made Captain
of his Company, viz.: on the 18th of December.</p>

<p>On the 4th day of the following May (1863) Captain Horton was
engaged with his Regiment in the battle of Chancellorville, Virginia.
The Regiment went into this engagement with 419 men, and during
the fight had 234 killed or wounded; and for its firm constancy and
bravery was warmly complimented, both by General Birney and General
Graham.</p>

<p>At Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, in July, 1863, this Regiment was
again actively engaged. And of Capt. Horton, Gen. Madill, in his
report says: "Capt. Horton, though severely stunned by concussion
of shell, remained in the field, and I am greatly indebted to him for
his services, <em>as he was the only Captain left with the Regiment</em>." On
the 3d of July, at Gettysburg, Capt. Horton commanded the Regiment.
At the morning roll-call of this fearful day, 198 men answered to their
names; of this number, 136 were either killed or wounded. On the
31st of the following January (1864) Captain Horton was commissioned
Major, commanding his Regiment. And on the 28th of the next
month (February, 1864,) he was commissioned Lieutenant-Colonel,
commanding his Regiment until Lee's surrender, April 9th, 1865.</p>

<p>On the 12th of May, Col. Horton was wounded, during the engagement
at Spottsylvania, Virginia, by a gun-shot through his left forearm
and in his left hip.</p>

<p>During his wounded condition, he was visited by his uncle, Hon.
George F. Horton, M. D., and was tenderly nursed by his sister
Louisa, wife of Hon. Uriah Terry. While convalescing, and not yet
well enough to take the field, he was appointed on several Courts-Martial,
and also had charge of several convoys of new men, conducting
them to posts along the southern sea-board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>With his Regiment, he was honorably mustered out of the service at
the close of the war, May 28th, 1865.</p>

<p>Of Col. Horton's old Company "A," consisting of 117 members,
there were killed, 16; died, 9; discharged for disability, 20; discharged
for wounds, 15; transferred to veteran corps for wounds, 7; transferred
to 57th Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteers, for unexpired term of
service, 14; absent in hospital, wounded, 4; dishonorably discharged,
1; leaving, at the mustering out of the Regiment, of the whole 117,
only 31.</p>

<p>Col. Horton was engaged in the following battles, namely: Fredericksburg,
Cedars, Chancellorville, Gettysburg, Wilderness, Spottsylvania,
Petersburg, Weldon Railroad, White-Oak Road, Sailors' Creek,
and at Lee's surrender; besides participating in many small skirmishes.</p>

<p>Honorably freed from his military service by the happy close of the
war, Col. Horton hasted home to be the business stay of his aged father,
and was actively engaged in mercantile pursuits up to 1871.</p>

<p>In October (24th) 1866, he was married, at Worcester, Massachusetts,
to <span class="smcap">Abby H. Newcomb</span>, only daughter of Charles and Lucy R.
Newcomb, of that city. Miss Lucy Sanderson Horton is their only
child; she was born December 18th, 1872.</p>

<p>Since 1871, Col. Horton has been living at Birch Creek (formerly
Bernice Colliery), Sullivan County, Pa., and is Superintendent of
"The Sullivan Anthracite Coal Company's" works, located at that
place.</p>

<p>The high appreciation in which he is held by the Company, is
shared by the community under his employ, who have several times
combined in tendering to him, as their Superintendent and considerate
friend, testimonials of large intrinsic value, but still more valuable as
evidences of their cordial and grateful esteem.</p>

<p>The Republicans of his County unanimously urged him as their
nominee for Congress in the fall of 1874, but were overruled by the
other Counties of the District.</p>

<p class="p1 pfs80">[<em>From the Presbyterian.</em>]</p>

<p class="fs80">In Terrytown, Pa., on the 7th inst., Miss Nancy T. daughter of Dr. G. F. and
Abigail Horton, aged twenty-five years. Born of pious parents, from infancy she
enjoyed the advantages of religious culture. In early life she made profession of
faith in Christ, and ever after adorned that profession with a consecrated life and
godly deportment. She was among the first to unite with the then recently organized
Presbyterian church at Terrytown, which she loved with the ardor of a sanctified
affection. Possessed of unusual decision of character and strong convictions of the
truth of her opinions, she nevertheless exercised a broad charity for those whom she
thought conscientiously differed from her. Her amiability, intelligence, purity, and
warm affection won her a large circle of friends, over whom she had great influence.
Her end was peace, and in full assurance of a blessed immortality. One incident,
among many others, may be given as illustrating the ground of her confidence.
Shortly before her death, clasping her arms around her brother's neck, she whispered:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"Nothing in my hand I bring,</p>
<p class="verse">Simply to the cross I cling."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="fs80">This simple clinging to the cross was her support through the long months of
wasting sickness, the secret of her patience in suffering, and the staff of her strength
through the valley of the shadow of death.</p>

N. Y., in March, 1859, to <span class="smcap">Fanny Caroline Beebe</span>, daughter

"<cite>Signs of the Times</cite>," and sister of the Hon. George M. Beebe, member
of Congress from Orange Co., N. Y., and born in Middletown, N. Y.,
exact date not given. Dr. Horton graduated in Albany Medical College,
Class of 1856. He established an office and commenced the
practice of medicine at Middletown, N. Y., and was very successful.
After his marriage he removed to Kansas, and settled at Atchison.
On his way returning home from a journey East he was instantly
killed, 3 Sept., 1861, by the fall of a bridge with a train of cars upon
it, one of which he was in, which spanned the Little Platte River, nine
miles east of St. Joseph, Missouri. The bridge had been partly burned
by the rebels, but left standing ready to fall when the cars came upon
it, for the purpose of killing Union soldiers. Thirteen persons were
killed, and over eighty badly injured by this barbarous outrage. The
Doctor's corpse was taken to Middletown, and buried in the Hill Cemetery
by the side of his father, and mother, and sisters.</p>

<p>They had one child, Mary Evelyn, born 3 Aug., 1861. After the

Co., N. Y., 13 March, 1837; married in Middletown, N. Y., by the
Rev. Mr. Harris, 26 May, 1864, to <span class="smcap">Anna Amelia Robertson</span>, daughter
of William Wells Robertson and Adaline Sayer, and born in
Centerville, Minnisink Township, 2 July, 1840.</p>

<p>Children:</p>

<p>Albert H. Horton attended the public school at West Town, N. Y.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
until 13 years of age, and then attended the "<em>Farmer's Hall Academy</em>,"
at Goshen, Orange Co., New York, and was there prepared for college.
He entered the "University of Michigan," as a freshman, and remained
there two years, but was compelled to leave college on account of
inability to study, owing to some trouble with his eyes. In 1857, he
entered the law office of Hon. Joseph W. Gott, at Goshen, New York,
as a law student, and remained there until December 18th, 1858, when
he was admitted as a counsellor and attorney at-law, at a general term
of the N. Y. Supreme Court, held in Brooklyn, New York. In 1859,
he went West, with his brother, and the Hon. George M. Beebe, now
member of Congress from New York State, to engage in the practice
of the law. He formed a partnership in the law business with Mr.
Beebe, under the firm name of Beebe &amp; Horton, at Macon, Moscow,
Mo., in 1859, but both parties soon became tired of Missouri, and removed
to Kansas. Mr. Beebe soon became Secretary of the Territory
of Kansas, and their acting Governor. Mr. Horton selected Atchison,
Atchison Co., Kansas, as his adopted home, and has resided there
ever since. In 1860, he was appointed City Attorney of Atchison, by
the Mayor, the Hon. Geo. H. Fairchild. In the Spring of 1861, he
was elected City Attorney of the same city, on the Union ticket. In
September of 1864, he was appointed District Judge of the 2d Judicial
District, of Kansas, by the Governor, Hon. Chas. H. Robinson. He
was elected and re-elected to the same office, and then resigned in
1865, to continue the practice of his profession. On his entering
practice, he was again elected City Attorney of Atchison, and held the
position one year. In 1868, he was elected as one of the State Electors
on the Republican State ticket in Kansas, and was selected the
messenger to take the vote of Kansas to Washington, to be deposited
with the Vice-President for Grant and Colfax. From 1861 to 1864, in
addition to attending to the duties of Judge of the District Court, he
edited, with Hon. John J. Ingalls, the weekly "<cite>Champion</cite>,"&mdash;a newspaper
printed and published at Atchison. Mr. Ingalls is now the U.
S. Senator from Kansas. In May, 1869, Mr. Horton was appointed,
by President Grant, U. S. District Attorney of Kansas, and he held
this office till July 18th, 1873, and then resigned the position. Upon
the resignation of Judge Delabay, U. S. Judge of Kansas, in 1874,
Mr. Horton's name was mentioned very prominently in connection
with the vacant Judgeship, and at a State Bar meeting, called to recommend
names for the position, Mr. Horton was presented by the
majority of the lawyers present for the place. Owing to some difference
of opinion <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'among the the Kansas'">among the Kansas</ins> delegation in Congress, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Hon. C. G. Foster, of Atchison, was appointed in his stead. Mr.
Horton still continues the practice of his profession at Atchison, and
is the local attorney of the Chicago and Rock Island R. R. Co., and
the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe R. R. Co., at that place. In March,
1873, Horton was associated with the Hon. Caleb Cushing, of Massachusetts,
in the defence of Senator S. C. Pomeroy, before the U. S. Senate
Investigating Committee, charged to inquire into certain pretended
charges of bribery, connected with the Senatorial election in Kansas,
in January, 1873. After a lengthy examination, Senator Pomeroy was
acquitted by a majority of the Senatorial Committee. Afterwards the
charges against Mr. Pomeroy were dismissed in Kansas, and the case
against him never came to trial. In the Fall of 1873, Horton was
elected by upwards of 500 majority to the Legislature of Kansas, and
took a prominent part in the impeachment of Hon. Josiah E. Hayes,
State Treasurer of Kansas. Mr. Horton was chairman of the committee
which reported and carried the impeachment through the House,
in February, 1874, and was then appointed Chairman of the Board
of Managers to prosecute the impeached Treasurer before the State
Senate. The State Treasurer then resigned, and the impeachment
ended. In politics Mr. Horton is a Republican, but belongs to the
Conservative side of the party.</p>

<p>The celebrated York-Pomeroy Bribery Case was brought to a final
termination on the eleventh of March, 1875, and the $7,000 historic
package was turned over to Mr. Pomeroy's counsel, the Hon. A. H.
Horton. Great credit is due Judge Horton for his untiring efforts in
having such an unjust and malicious prosecution brought to a close.</p>

<p>"The Patriarchs, Nathan and Samuel Horton, who settled in Bedford

has been adopted by a great many of both families, and many of their
descendants are at this time the best mechanics of the country. I have
myself a set of blacksmith tools, brought from Philadelphia by my
grandfather when he moved out, and the bellows bears the brand 'D.
C. Dawson, Philadelphia, 1774,' and I do not keep them as an heirloom,

A happy union of the North and South. The bridal party left
immediately for New York City, stopping for a few days at the St.
Nicholas, where they received the <em>elite</em> of the city, and then went to
Baltimore, where at Barnum's, Mrs. Jordan, with the ease and grace
of manner so natural to her, received their friends, and made the
entertainment very interesting. From Baltimore they proceeded to
Mr. Jordan's home in the Old North State.</p>

<p>Mr. Jordan is a son of Matthias Jordan and Sally Smith, both of illustrious
English descent, and on the mother's side tracing back to the
Colonial Governor of Virginia. They were planters, on the James

family; under date of May, 1871, she says:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"In regard to leading
traits of character of the Horton family, I may speak of the disposition
manifested in my own line. Some might set them down as too dogmatical.
I do admit that most of them are rather tenacious of their
own opinions. Especially were my grandfather and his brother Barnabas
positive and firm men. But I do not think this trait of character
is so prominent in other branches of the family. In regard to
punctuality and uprightness, they can present as untarnished a record
as any other family. I have never heard of any of them being imprisoned
for debt or misdemeanor. Their social standing has always been
good. As to mental capacity, I believe they have generally been people
of good common sense. They have not, so far as I know, ever
made any special mark in the literary or scientific world. Politically,
as a general thing, they embrace and adhere to the <em>Democratic idea</em>&mdash;the
idea of freedom and equal rights. They have mainly followed
agricultural pursuits. I believe frugality has ever been a leading characteristic
of the family, in all its history, and we find this trait of
character still prominent, despite the great amount of prodigality and
unthrift witnessed in these times."</p></div>

<p>In "<cite>New Haven Colonial Records</cite>," as furnished by Stuart T. Terry,
of Southold, we learn that he was a very prominent man; a merchant,
an auctioneer, teacher of a select school, and often drew up legal documents.
He also had charge of the church money, and under date of
5 Nov., 1716, he says: "Uncle Joshua Horton came to my house and
weighed the church's money, Uncle Wells also being present." To
his eldest son, Azariah W., he wills Rawley's History and a small cane,
and to his grandson, son of Jonathan Horton, deceased, "my homestead
and houses in the first Parish of Southold, also my gun and
silver-hilted sword." He gives to the three daughters of his son Lazarus,
£15 each; to his grandsons, sons of his son Ambrose, "all the
buildings where my son Ambrose now lives&mdash;son Ambrose to have the
improvement of the land as long as he lives&mdash;also the farming implements
he hath at Rone Oak." He also makes bequests to his daughter
Mary Mabel, and her son Moses. He appoints for his executors
"my trusty friend William Horton and my son Joseph Cleveland."
Will signed 3 Oct., 1764. We have no other record of Joseph
Cleveland.</p>

X. <span class="smcap">Jonathan</span>, son of Capt. <a href="#Jam-BARNABAS_III">Barnabas Horton and Susanna Bailey</a>,
born in Southold, Sept., 1765. "Dea. Jonathan, as he was familiarly
called, was the fifth son of Capt. Barnabas Horton of Hogneck, now
Bay View, L. I. He married <span class="smcap">Miss Hallock</span>, with whom he lived
about thirty years in Mattituck Center. In early life he pursued the
trade of a blacksmith. In later years that of a farmer. He embraced
religion in early life, and united with the Presbyterian Church of
Southold, and was chosen a Deacon and an Elder. He filled these
offices for more than thirty years. For the greater part of his life he
stood in official stations, and by them he was much burthened. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
in all his civil, military, ecclesiastical and judicial relations, he was
well sustained and gave general satisfaction. The many and complex
cares wore upon his naturally good constitution, and at length led on
to a lingering consumption which called him to his grave, 19 Jan.,
1819, in the 54th year of his age.</p>

<p>His children were two sons and two daughters, viz.:</p>

heard him spoken of as 'Uncle' William. He was a large landholder&mdash;owned
and occupied the old house in which I was born. It was
taken down in 1854, and the house in which my father, Joseph Hazzard
Horton, now lives, was erected upon its site. It was built by his
grandfather, son of Jonathan I. He was thrice married, 1. to <span class="smcap">Patience
Corwin</span>; 2. <span class="smcap">Martha Gardiner</span>, a very pious lady. She was confined
to her bed a long time by sickness, previous to her death, and by her
request, the Rev. Elam Potter prepared her funeral sermon, and read
it to her previous to her death, which occurred in 1792; married 3.

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"He occupied the east side of the old house, my grandfather, David
Horton, the west side. My grandfather took the farm, and cared for
'Uncle' William's mother, who lived to be very aged. He always
lived in good style, and kept several slaves. His third wife had the
first woolen carpet ever known in that vicinity. A good stock
of liquors was always found upon his board, and he allowed no wood
except hickory to be used for fuel.</p>

<p>"He was a gentleman who always rode in his chaise, and spent
much of his time in fishing and other amusements, and the 'William
Horton Rock,' one of his most frequent fishing points, is famous
to this day. He died without issue. His third wife survived him,
and after his death she sold 'Tom' for $100, and 'Hagar' for $70.
She married <span class="smcap">Josiah Vail</span>&mdash;lived happily for many years in the cottage
a little west of the old Barnabas Horton Homestead."&mdash;<cite>Letter of D.

<p>At the age of 18 the Doctor entered the junior class at Union College,
and he was soon distinguished for his close application to his studies
and strict regard for integrity. After his collegiate course, he
studied medicine, and attended medical lectures in the medical department
of the University of New York, during the palmy days of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Mitchell and Hosack, and like these eminent teachers, he cultivated a
taste for patient, cautious and bold investigation, which afterwards
made him so distinguished and successful in the medical profession.</p>

<p>He commenced the practice of medicine at the residence of his
father, and he soon possessed the confidence of the people and secured
a large practice. He afterwards moved to the village of Goshen, and
soon became a prominent man among his medical brethren, and,
though young, he was nevertheless called upon to perform all the difficult
and grave surgical operations occurring in the village, and also in
the surrounding country. He was a good surgeon, but he was still
more celebrated as a physician. By his skill and honorable bearing,
he early secured the confidence of his medical brethren, and he was
frequently called in consultation with the aged and experienced physicians
of his day. He was remarkably successful in the treatment of
fevers, carefully studying their pathology at the bedside, and also by
post-mortem examinations, and in his views he was greatly in advance
of the profession of his day. He prepared with great labor a work on
fevers, but never published it. His pamphlet on Dysentery, and his
Geological Reports, are his only published works, and these are sufficient
to establish his reputation as a profound thinker and a clear and
powerful writer.</p>

<p>At the bedside he was cheerful, affectionate and soothing, and
always dignified. In his intercourse with his medical brethren he was
always honorable, and in harmony with the code of medical ethics.</p>

<p>In the midst of his career of usefulness as a physician, he turned his
attention to the study of botany, mineralogy and geology, and soon
became one of the most noted men of his day in these sciences. His
great delight in these studies led him, at the age of 37, to relinquish
the practice of medicine and devote himself wholly to these sciences,
and had he lived a few days longer, he would have published a large
work on these subjects. The Doctor was also fond of archæological
lore, and he was the first to attempt a genealogical history of the
descendants of our old progenitor, Barnabas, of 1640. The old Horton
roll of names and lineage which he got up some 60 years ago, was
kindly furnished me by his son, Dr. William Horton, of Craigville,
N. Y., and has rendered me valuable assistance in compiling the
"Chronicles."</p>

<p>Dr. Horton was always rigidly moral, and never sacrificed principle
to expediency. He had early been taught to respect the teachings of
the Bible, and towards the close of his life he was led, with a child-like
faith, to believe the doctrine of salvation by grace, and to publicly
give himself to the Saviour, wondering and regretting that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
so long remained ignorant of the beauty, simplicity and sublimity of
the Gospel scheme of salvation. Thus he died, in hope of a glorious
immortality.</p>

<p>"My father's name was Thomas Horton. My mother's maiden
name was Hannah Moore. My grandfather's name was also Thomas
Horton. He was a soldier in the Revolutionary War, and he and his
brother-in-law, Nathan Moore, were taken prisoners when the British
captured Fort Montgomery, and they were imprisoned in a vessel in
New York Harbor, called 'a prison ship.' I never heard any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
name for it. In that prison, by hard treatment and starvation, they
were reduced so low that when set at liberty they both died before
they got home. There were several other prisoners on that prison
ship who lost their lives by the same cruel treatment.</p>

<p>"My father had ten children&mdash;4 sons and 6 daughters&mdash;all lived
to be heads of families. I have often heard my father speak of a certain
cup with the name of a bank on it, where a large sum of money
was left by his father. When that cup was taken to the bank they
could draw money. He said the cup was lost and how much money
with it he did not know."</p></div>

<p>Capt. Horton commenced a sea-faring life when about 19 years old,
with Capt. Nathaniel Case, in the ship <i>Triad</i>. With a crew of about
25 men, they made a voyage of about nine months in the South Atlantic
Ocean, in latitude 35 to 40°, and longitude 10 to 20°. The
voyage was prosperous and the business paid well. He afterwards made
a voyage on the Indian Ocean and South Sea. He followed the business
for 13 years, and during that time, he circumnavigated the earth
four times. It is a remarkable fact that, notwithstanding all the hazard
and danger of a sea-faring life, they never lost a man by accident or
sickness. They were all temperate men, and this had much to do
with their immunity from danger, sickness and death. The Captain
quaintly remarks that a half gallon demi-john of liquor was not used
by the whole crew, as a beverage, during any one of their voyages.
During the time he followed the sea he visited the Sandwich Islands,
the Society Isles, and also New Zealand. On the island of Owyhee he
saw the place where Capt. Cook was killed by the natives.</p>

<p>The last voyage was in 1846&ndash;47 and 48, and during this voyage the
Captain had command of the ship. He took but two gallons of spirits
with him on that voyage, and part of that he brought back with him.</p>

<p>The Captain is beautifully situated at Peconic, L. I.&mdash;has a beautiful
farm, which he knows how to keep in good order, and his house,
among the best in the township of Southold, is admirably kept by his
amiable and accomplished lady, and nearly every room in it is richly
ornamented with frames and cases of rare, costly and beautiful sea-shells,
most tastefully arranged, and all done by the delicate hands of
Mrs. Horton herself. Great skill and persevering effort were required
to accomplish so much.</p>

<p>We are indebted to Mr. J. A. Shepherd, of San Diego, for the following
interesting sketch of the life of Mr. A. E. Horton:</p>


<p class="p2 pfs100">ALONZO E. HORTON.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To a person acquainted with this gentleman our introduction would sound unfamiliar.
"Here is A. E. Horton, of San Diego," is all that he would allow to be
said before he would be acquainted with a room-full of strangers. His motto
is "action," and he has practiced it long and faithfully. He would leave ceremony
in the lurch to talk <em>business</em>, and never think apology necessary; and we can think
of no better rule to follow in writing what we know of him.</p>

<p>His parents commenced their westward march in 1815, from Union, Ct., when
Alonzo was two years old. Their home for the next four years was in Stockbridge,
Madison Co., N. Y. Then a residence of two years in New Haven, Oswego County,
where the first school lessons were taken under the direction of Miss Patty Woodward.
When he was eleven years old the family reached the shore of Lake Ontario, in the
town of Scriba, and moved into their new log-house.</p>

<p>Then followed a year of muscular as well as mental discipline to the lad Alonzo.
His father was suddenly bereft of sight by a severe inflammatory attack upon his
eyes. School was two miles away, and to and fro our student made his morning
and evening tramps in pursuit of knowledge. But he was the eldest boy of the
household, and to him after study came toil. His evenings were spent in basket-making,
which assisted largely in providing for the wants of the family. Thus for
about a year he bravely essayed to lift the burden from his father's shoulders.
From that time until he was half through his twenty-first year, he was first assistant
wood-chopper on the home-lot, where they filled Oswego orders for hewed timber.</p>

<p>He commenced business for himself by purchasing the remaining six months of
his minority, agreeing to pay $50 to his father for that purpose. In eight months
from that time he had been a grocery clerk at $12 a month; a lake sailor before the
mast; and the last half of the time owner and captain of the "Wild Goose," a small
vessel he had purchased, and put into the wheat trade between Oswego and Canada.
His marine speculation proved quite a profitable one for those days; he sold out
and closed business, paid all his obligations, and had $300 in his pocket. During
the winter of 1834-'35 he learned the trade of a cooper, and his specialty for a time
was flour-barrels. Then the city of Oswego elected him constable, by the largest
majority given to any man on the Whig ticket. The young officer was too kind-hearted
to make his office pay, and he lost all he made in trade by failing to enforce
payment from poor debtors according to law. Out of office he invested $7 in a contract
for land, and in a month made $336 on the venture. Young Horton had
another strong point, which was often brought into play in the inevitable wrestling-matches
incident to town-meetings of long ago. His 130 pounds was a most
animated and unmanageable load for his largest companions to handle, and
at "square hold" he was the acknowledged champion of the township. Yet he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
pronounced a consumptive by Dr. Van Schaick, with the advice "Go West&mdash;it may
do you good; but I think it probable you will not live more than six months." He
took the doctor's prescription, and went West.</p></div>

<div class="caption">A. E. Horton</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He landed in Milwaukee, in May, 1836, and soon after was one of a party of six
on the <em>trail</em> for the Rock River country. There were no roads, and the best inn to
be found was to turn in their blankets under an oak tree. But the mosquitoes
promptly presented bills for their lodgings. After thirty nights camping, they
reached the cabin of Mr. and Mrs. Janes, the parents of the now lively city of Janesville.
Theirs was the only house, and that about 10x16 feet in size, but immense in
hospitality. After partaking of the latter, the party (among whom were the names
of Churchill, Odell, Ogden and Jewett) continued on until reaching the foot of
Koskonong Lake, where each one made a quarter-section claim, built a cabin, and
went back to Milwaukee. One of those claims, at least, was left for another pre-emptor,
with the cabin thrown in, for Horton was soon too busy to think farther
about it. Others waited, with hands in pockets, for the approaching land sales; he
took up the shovel and worked on the new streets. Money was worth too much to be
wasted by idleness. A working-man always gains more profitable knowledge than
a loafer. His capital was labor and observation, and out of these were to be
wrought a fortune.</p>

<p>Of the two hotels then in the new city, he had selected the Bellevue for his lodgings.
Two bits a night paid for his share of a room, and his own blankets were bed
and bedding. His room-mates were sometimes as many as sixteen; and his rule
was "early to bed." Two nephews of the Receiver at the Land-Office came in
one evening full of an important secret which they must talk over. The young fellow
who worked on the road was the only one retired, besides themselves, and his
hearty snoring satisfied them that he was beyond hearing. Their authority was official,
so no danger of mistakes. The bills of the Michigan State Bank and Farmers'
and Mechanics' Bank would be taken at par at the land sales, and consequently
would be as good as gold, and worth the premium of at least 10 per cent. They
would quietly gather it in for the occasion. The next day our sleeper was <em>not</em> shoveling
on the street. He was learning the whereabouts of holders of certain styles of
Michigan currency, and was soon doing a brisk exchange business with his New
York Safety Fund Savings, amounting to $300. At night he was in his room,
happy in the prospective addition to his funds; but there were two other persons
there who thought they had little success in securing the coveted currency. It was
unaccountable, for were they not the only individuals to whom the secret had been
imparted?</p>

<p>The sales of Government land commenced the following day, and Horton was
present with his receivable funds. He bought no land, but his money was in immediate
and continuous demand. Many times during the sale he retired to replenish
his bank stock by exchanging bank notes with numerous parties according to previous
arrangement. The enterprise was a financial success. Here his quick perception
did him good service, for he was marked as a prize by a thieving gang. One of
them formed his acquaintance on the evening of a profitable day, and tried to learn
his intended movements. Yes, he would soon go to his lodging-place; but that
night he concluded it would be best <em>for him</em> to remain where he was, and he did so.
But another young man, about his age, and similarly dressed, was waylaid on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
very route Horton was expected to travel, caught, gagged and carried off to a safe
place for robbery. In the dark they had captured the wrong man, as his empty
pockets and the cut of his coat proved on careful examination.</p>

<p>Thinking the country a safer place, he went out three miles, to where his uncle,
Dwight Foster, was superintending one of the first saw-mills built in Wisconsin.
While there another attempt was made to entrap him. One, Robinson, came from
town to inform him that a man named Johnson would take a named sum for some
land which he had talked of buying. He must be sharp if the trade was secured,
and should take his money with him for that reason. Horton promptly decided to
take <em>more</em>, and quietly deposited a loaded pistol in each pocket of his hunter's coat.
His caller carried a suspicious-looking hickory cudgel, altogether too cumbersome
for a cane, and explained that he had been tracking a wild animal, which he hoped
they could identify by the marks. In a low, marshy place, a little off their road, its
tracks were most clearly made. Descending to the spot indicated, he urged Horton
to follow him, and determine what sort of creature had crossed there. Instead of
complying Horton presented a pistol, told his man if he found no tracks there
as described, he would shoot him without further notice. The villain was outwitted,
and preferred returning to town a short distance in advance of the ready weapons
of his captor. It was ascertained that Johnson knew nothing of the fellow's errand,
and that the only foot-prints about the miry trap in which Robinson had hoped to
catch his game, were made by himself. He was next heard of, a few years afterwards,
in the Iowa penitentiary, committed for horse-stealing.</p>

<p>Returning to the East Mr. Horton passed the time until 1840, in various places
and employments, the last being at St. Mary's with the American Fur Co. His first
western <em>home</em> was purchased in the town of Oakland, Wis., that year, to which
locality his father and family followed not long after. In a few months more he
had established himself matrimonially and happily. Three years engaged in miscellaneous
trade, land figuring as the principal item, he became a cattle-dealer. He
bought his beef in Illinois, did the largest part of the driving, and averaged
two trips in five weeks. He furnished his customers so satisfactorily in his own and
adjoining counties, that in one year his original capital of $150 was increased to
$4,000. In St. Louis he saw profits in land-warrants, and bought sufficient
to locate 1,500 acres of land. Out of this investment grew the village of <em>Hortonville</em>,
in Outagamie Co., Wis. His first town was buried in the woods, and he went
to work with eight men to cut a four-mile road to his proposed mill-site. By the time
he had lots to sell, he was sawing lumber with which to improve them. The prices
and payment for material was of small account with the proprietor. Houses must be
built, whether settlers had money or not. In a year from the completion of the
mill, 150 people were <em>living</em> in Hortonville, and at the end of two years sold out the
remaining property, being $7,188 better for his enterprise.</p>

<p>In 1851, Mr. Horton went to California for the first time. Mining-stock was his
first business experience, and it cost him $1,000. It was his <em>last</em> transaction in that
line also. Spent a few months at mining in El Dorado and Placer Counties,
and then opened a store at Pilot Hill. There also he devised and constructed a
ditch 6½ miles in length, purposing to supply the miners with water as well as other
commodities. At the end of a year he had sold out his water-works and other interests
for $6,500, of which sum he had used the larger portion in his improvements.
Next he was trading in gold-dust on account of Adams' Express Co., realizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
usually $30 a day in commissions. A day or two before the failure of his employers,
in 1853, a friend suggested to him, that his money remaining in their office at &mdash;&mdash;,
might be safer in his own pocket. It was "a word to the wise," and before noon
the next day he had ridden 30 miles, and much to the dissatisfaction of the agent,
drawn his money from the safe of the company. His next care was for his friends
hard at work in the mining-camps and elsewhere. To all whom he could reach he
gave the hint, and thousands of dollars were secured, by his prompt efforts, to those
who had earned the money by the hardest of toil. The following day the express
offices were closed, and payments suspended. He was in capital standing in the
mining districts where he had operated, and resumed the business with himself for
banker. He bought at the mines and sold in the towns, often with a profit of $4.50
per ounce. He was a man of <em>dust</em>, and with his native adroitness, managed to carry
valuable deposits of the precious article upon his person without a single mishap.
Sometimes his outer garments would scarcely secure him other than the slightest
attentions. His landlords were afraid their bills would be unpaid, except his fares
were collected in advance. He arrived one evening at one of the rough taverns of
those times, with treasure enough about him to incite the gamblers about him to
worse crimes for its possession. His good clothes were covered with very dirty overalls
and woolen shirt. In calculating Yankee phrase, he interrogated the proprietor
as to his accommodations for man and beast, and the reasonableness of his <em>charges</em>.
Card-playing ceased for a time in the general astonishment, then the party shouted
with laughter at the green chap from Connecticut. They bantered him to play off
a Yankee trick. He showed them how to eat the mush and milk, which he had
stipulated for as his supper, and with a yawn of indifference to the jests made at his
expense, he signified his desire to sleep. The door of his room was without lock or
bolt, but the landlord laughingly assured his guest, that he would be the last man
anybody would think of robbing. He awoke next morning from an undisturbed
sleep, and at breakfast-time was up and <em>dressed</em>. He passed over a small package
of <em>dust</em> in settlement, which was accepted and pronounced all right. Word was
sent to the stable, his horse could <em>now</em> be brought out&mdash;his bill was paid.</p>

<p>"Mister, want to <em>buy</em> some more o' that stuff?"</p>

<p>"Yes;" replying with a surprised look.</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"Suppose I can buy all <em>you</em> have to sell."</p>

<p>"Will you treat this 'ere crowd ef you can't?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will, and <em>yeou</em>, too."</p>

<p>Diminutive sacks of dust were handed to the wondering host, and the coin
counted out in return. By the time $2500 had exchanged hands, the landlord's
$20-pieces were exhausted, and our Yankee had played the "trick" with a $250
pile still in reserve. The laugh came in then louder than the night before; and as
the glasses were being filled the buyer of gold-dust remarked, irreligiously, that he
would have robbed the fellow himself if he had known how he was playing him.</p>

<p>The business was as suitable as profitable to the man, and so well did he manage
it, that his profits for the last quarter of 1854, were $1000 per month. Another success
was in a novel undertaking for those golden days. He went prospecting for
ice-fields, and finding a favorable situation 25 miles above Georgetown, in El Dorado
County, put up 312 tons of the cool mountain product. A few months afterwards
the speculation returned him eight thousand dollars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>In March, 1856, among the passengers on board the steamship <i>Cortez</i>, for Panama,
was Mr. Horton. Soon after their arrival at the isthmus, the memorable rising of
the natives took place. The mob would have had easy work in carrying out the
plan of outrage and plunder, but for the prompt and courageous action of our friend
and a few of his companions. Among nearly 200 people from the steamer, who
were dining at the hotel where the attack was made, there were but three with
fire-arms. The announcement that the rioters were coming, caused a stampede
from the table to the upper rooms. On bursting into the house, the leading ruffians
were halted at the stairway by <em>Capt.</em> Horton and his aids, and as the attempt to ascend
was made, a few effective shots drove the assailants into the street. Immediately
the reign of terror and bloodshed began.</p>

<p>"Please, sir, save my father!" was an appeal from a little boy, as he pointed to
where a swarthy assassin stood taking aim at a defenceless man. The American's
revolver was leveled and fired just in time to render the other's shot harmless by
his own fall. Others were protected by the same faithful hand and stern purpose
as they retreated towards the only place of safety&mdash;the American steamer. Arriving
at the water, the crowd rushed on to a small steam-tug, and but for the quick
thought and bold action of our leader, would have been overtaken by the pursuing
mob. He took command, gave his orders to fasten to a lighter near at hand, transferred
his passengers to the larger craft, and signalled the engineer to start for the
<i>Cortez</i>. Fortunately, he was obeyed without question, and a more successful trip
was never made by the <i>Wild Goose</i> and her commander on Lake Ontario! His
money loss was some $10,000, but he could count untold gain in the saving of lives,
and to this day he refers to his participation in those fearful scenes with satisfaction
not to be calculated in coin.</p>

<p>On their arrival in New York, Mr. Horton was named by his fellow-passengers
as the person to proceed to Washington, to make a statement of the occurrences at
Panama, in response to a call from the authorities to that effect. From that time
until his marriage in 1861, he made several journeys between Washington and Wisconsin,
as a witness in the riot case and a claimant for damage. His testimony was
important in deciding the demand for reparation made by the United States upon
the Government of New Grenada. His own claim was most strenuously and successfully
opposed by the Spanish commissioner. He had done too much injury to
his people to have <em>his</em> losses repaid. <em>All</em> other claims were not so objectionable;
and as a compromise in the final settlement, the man who deserved a General's
commission for courage and strategic skill, and liberal pay for the personal risks
taken in his defense of American citizens, was stricken from the list of creditors.</p>

<p>Starting again for the Pacific coast soon after the civil war was began at Sumpter,
he included a trip to British Columbia in his travels. At Lewiston, on the Columbia
River, he began to think of the outfit needed for the journey. His effects inventoried
one gold pencil, a single-barreled pistol, and $15 cash. To his brother-in-law,
Mr. Charles Wright, who was one of his traveling companions, and much better
provided with equipments, he intimated that he must do a little <em>trading</em> before he
could proceed. In half a day he had exchanged his jewelry and pistol for a pair of
horses; sold one of them again at a clean profit of $50; paid $15 for a third; and
early in the afternoon returned to camp with two good animals, fine revolver, saddles,
blankets, and about $60 in money. Trading was his special success&mdash;speculation
invariably a failure. For a distance of 1400 miles through the northern wilder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>ness,
that Lewiston revolver brought down most of the game upon which the company
feasted by the way. In the Salmon River country, trees and the feathery snow
furnished most comfortable bedding. They sold their surplus provisions to a British
customs officer on the route, at a profit of 66 per cent. At Lytton, they replenished
their stock, and loaded five of their horses with saleable goods. They found a market
at Williams' Creek for flour at $1.00 per pound, and for bacon at $1.25.</p>

<p>Arriving at the Cariboo mining district, the party bought the "Darkey's Claim."
It was a rich prospect, and they worked the lead until snow closed the operations,
taking an ounce of gold from a bucket of dirt. At this time the claim would have
sold for thousands of dollars. After wintering at Victoria they returned to make
their fortunes, securing a force of workmen at $10 a day. After working four feet
further their riches "jumped" and vanished beyond recovery. Not a hundred feet
off three miners were taking out 75 ounces per day, and others doing equally well.
But the "Darkey" had "run out," and the owners accepted $200 for their lost
treasure. Mining has had no attraction for him to this day.</p>

<p>When Mr. Horton reached San Francisco again, his financial condition would
have caused a "panic" in any other man. In capital he was "broke," but in
nothing else. Then as now, there were the strength and elasticity of steel in the
man's spirit and nerves. He first tried a stall in the market; but the dollar a day
realized caused him to retire from business in a short time. Buying and selling a
ranch in Rio Visto concluded his real-estate operations in that part of the State.
He was a dealer in second-hand furniture in San Francisco, when he first heard San
Diego discussed as one of the great cities of the future. The value of its harbor and
climate was the topic of the evening at a private literary gathering where he was
a frequent listener. What he had heard so impressed itself in his thoughts that
he could not sleep that night, until he had jumped out of bed, and satisfied his inquisitiveness
by a careful study of the map of California. The situation seemed
revealed as a prize especially for him. He determined to secure it, and&mdash;slept.</p>

<p>Here was the opportunity long sought and never despaired of. In three days the
stock was disposed of, and the store closed. The proceeds were small&mdash;perhaps
less than $500. No one among his friends could be induced to join him in his visionary
enterprise. Alone, on the 6th of April, 1867, Mr. Horton reached San Diego.
It exceeded his expectations, and obstacles in the way of purchase were quickly
swept aside by his indomitable energy. The few people there were having such a
quiet time, that they had become indifferent to the charm of office. The first work
was to get an election called for Trustees, those officers only being empowered to
sell lands belonging to the city. Candidates were provided and elected. The desired
property was legally advertised and sold, and on the 11th day of May following,
a deed of some 750 acres was made. Thirty-six cents an acre, and but one bidder!
Mr. Horton was the happy purchaser, and little did he care that his investment
was looked upon by most of the 150 people then in San Diego, as a wild
expenditure of money.</p>

<p>The work of advertising the new city was immediately commenced. The tin case
in which he carried the first map of "Horton's Addition to San Diego," through the
streets of San Francisco, is carefully treasured in his office, and could not be bought
for its weight in gold. Horton was everywhere, and irresistible in glowing dreams
of the future of his city. His labors were untiring from the time he measured off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
blocks and lots with a tape-line, and laid out the streets for his workmen to clear
from cactus and sage-brush, until the winter of 1869-'70, when his sales averaged
$15,000 a month. From $3,000 in 1867, his receipts increased to nearly $85,000
in 1869. His money built up the place as fast as received, and it is safe to state,
that $300,000 have been used by him for that purpose.</p>

<p>This is but an imperfect sketch of Mr. Horton's business career in San Diego.
He has richly earned the sobriquet of "Father of the City," and the respect and
best wishes of his fellow-citizens. His faith and works have been the <em>life</em> of the
place, when crops failed for want of rain, railroad hopes were delayed, or croakers
insisted on publishing its death as a certainty. Long may Horton live, and great
the prosperity he may witness in the pet child he has so bravely matured&mdash;<span class="smcap">his own
San Diego</span>!</p>

<p>Mr. Horton is a man of liberal views, and has always been an ardent and practical
advocate of political and religious freedom. To the poor, both black and white,
he has been a faithful friend. To-day, an honest man in homespun receives as
cordial a grasp of his hand, as the man in broadcloth and fine linen. That he has
the sympathy and respect of the masses of his fellow-citizens, was manifested in a
most gratifying manner in the vote given him in his county for State Senator, in the
contest of 1871. His opponent was the Democratic chief of the county, that had
never before failed to give a large Democratic majority. San Diego honored the
Republican Horton with a majority of 50, and he only failed in election by the
adjoining county (forming the balance of the district) voting as usual, largely Democratic.
Socially he is a warm-hearted, affable gentleman, true to his friends, and
watchful of those who play him false. Temperate in his habits, and always active
in mind and body, his health is as robust, and his personal appearance as young as
most men at 50 years. Last and best tribute to his character, is the kind care for his
parents in their helpless age, and that love for his <span class="smcap">Mother</span>, which to her was the
dearest and last earthly tie broken in her departure to the better Home.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Arthur Horton Cleveland, born in the city of Philadelphia, 10 Feb., 1865.</p></div>

<p>Mrs. Cleveland graduated from the Ladies' Department of Oberlin
College (Ohio), in 1853, and from the Woman's Medical College of
Pennsylvania, in 1855. She was elected to the Chair of Anatomy in
that College, in 1857, which she held until 1862, when she was trans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>ferred
to the Chair of Obstetrics. This she still occupies, and is also
a member of the Board of Corporators.</p>

<p>In 1860, at the solicitation of a number of philanthropic ladies of
Philadelphia, who had in view the establishment of a Hospital for
Women and Children, Professor Cleveland went abroad for medical
study, and to make herself acquainted with the arrangements and management
of hospitals. She entered the School of Obstetrics in connection
with the <em>Maternite</em> of Paris, and after receiving the diploma of
that institution, found ready access to the wards and lecture-rooms of
other hospitals, and was allowed free inspection of their administrative
departments.</p>

<p>On her return, she was chosen Resident Physician of the then
chartered Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia, which position she continued
to fill for seven years. She has been one of the Managers of
the Hospital from its organization, and a member of the Consulting
Board since her retirement from the office of Resident Physician.</p>

<p>Professor Cleveland has made a number of important surgical operations,
and is the first woman, so far as known, who ever performed
ovariotomy. In her second case, a tumor, weighing fifty pounds, was
successfully removed, the patient making a good recovery.</p>

New York, anterior to the Revolution. He was afterwards known as the American
Banker, Col. William Bayard. This vessel was afterwards rigged a brig, and sent
to sea and lost at Cape Horn, about 1825. Another vessel, bearing the same name,
in honor of Col. Bayard, was on the French line of packets&mdash;the first established
between New York and France, and owned principally by Messrs. Le Roy, Bayard
&amp; Co.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>My Dear Friend</em>: Your very kind and interesting letter of the
18th inst., came duly to hand some days since. I have often heard it
said that the Hortons of this country sprung from two brothers, who
emigrated from England at an early day, and that one of them settled
in Massachusetts, and the other on Long Island. My ancestor, Stephen
Horton, I think, was a descendant of Thomas Horton, who settled in
Springfield, Mass., perhaps a son of Thomas. My brother, John Horton,
many years since obtained from Dr. Horton, of Hartford, Ct.,
the genealogy that I send you. There was many years since a Dr.
Horton who resided at Springfield, whom my eldest sister visited, and
who was a relative of ours. He had a son who was also a doctor in
New York City, and also engaged in the grocery and provision business.
I think he is dead. I am satisfied that Barnabas Horton was a
brother of Thomas.</p>

<p>Stephen Horton settled in West Springfield, Mass. He had two
sons, Benjamin and Stephen. Benjamin, born in 1720; died at
Brandon, Vermont, 13 Jan., 1803. He left two sons, Gideon and
Moses, also a daughter, who married a Mr. Underwood.</p>

<p>Gideon Horton was born in 1744, in West Springfield, Mass.; married
Sarah Douglass, great aunt to the Hon. Stephen A. Douglass.
He died at Brandon, Vt., 16 Dec., 1801. His sons were Hiram,
Gideon, Jr., and John. Hiram, born 5 March, 1764, at West Springfield;
married Sarah Drury, 16 June, 1785, at Pittsford, Vt.; moved
to Malone, Franklin Co., N. Y., in 1808. He was one of the leading
men of the county, holding the office of County Treasurer, and first
Judge of the Courts for several years. He died 5 Oct., 1824.</p>

<p>He owned a large quantity of land, also mill-property, and several
mercantile stores. He belonged to the Presbyterian Church, and was
active and consistent in its duties. He had three sons and seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A-II" id="Page_A-II">[II]</a></span>
daughters. Sons were: Harry, John, and Hiram, Jr. (myself), all
born in Brandon, Vt. Harry, born 22 July, 1796; died in Constable,
N. Y., 22 August, 1840. He was a farmer, a merchant, and a manufacturer
of flour and lumber. He belonged to the Congregational
Church. He had two children, Hiram Safford Horton (married and
settled in Wisconsin, and has a large family), and Delia A. Horton,
who married Howard E. King, Esq., merchant at Malone. John, son
of Hiram. Sen., born 22 Dec., 1797; died at Madrid, St. Lawrence
Co., N. Y., 14 Oct., 1859, without issue. He was also a member of
the Congregational Church, and followed farming, milling, and lumbering.
Hiram, Jr., born 22 April, 1799; resides in Malone, N. Y.;
married 20 Jan., 1822, Adaline Wead. Has three children, all born
at Malone, N. Y. I. William L. Horton, born 28 Oct., 1822; died
19 Sept., 1861. He was a lawyer; left two children: George F. and
Anna M. Horton. II. Adeline Mead Horton, born 21 Jan., 1834;
married in Oct., 1864, Myron G. Horton, grandson of Dr. John Horton,
who was the son of Gideon Horton, Sen., being her 3d cousin.
They reside at Malone, N. Y., and have two children. III. Frederick,
born 22 August, 1838, and died 13 April, 1867, childless. I have now
named the male members of my branch of the family, and for the family
of Gideon Horton Jr., I refer you to Dr. Charles W. Horton, of
Brattleborough, Vt., one of his sons, and for the family of Dr. John
Horton, I refer you to his son, Dr. Geo. Horton, Winauskie Falls, Vt.
The Hortons seem to have been given largely to the medical profession.
When your work is accomplished, I shall be glad to have you send me
one copy.</p></div>

<p class="right padr6 fs80">I am yours, truly,</p>
<p class="right fs80">HIRAM HORTON.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Horton, the writer of the foregoing letter, was a highly-respected
member and Elder of the Presbyterian Church of Malone. He died
31 August, 1873. He was a dealer in flour, lumber, and dry-goods,
real-estate, and merchandising of various kinds. Mrs. Myron
G. Horton, informing me of his death, remarks that she is now (1874)
the only one of his children living.</p></div>

<p><em>Dear Sir</em>: While at Pomeroy a few weeks since on a visit, my
father showed me your letter, requesting information in regard to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A-III" id="Page_A-III">[III]</a></span>
descent, and asked me to answer your questions. I am not really in a
condition to give you any particular information, for the reason that
the notes I once made on the subject, when, in 1864, I graduated at
Dana College, are out of my reach. A sketch of our genealogy and
history had to be recorded in our "Class Book," and I there broke
ground in this to me until then, unattractive field, in obedience to
that necessity. The main facts that I recall are, however, these: I
did not get very far in tracing my descent. My father, Valentine B.
Horton, was the son of Zenas Horton, who was the son of David Horton&mdash;David
was born near the beginning of the last century; no! in
the 2d or 3d decade, and fought in the old French war, and was also a
soldier in the Revolution, and was killed at Saratoga. He lived in
Braintree, Mass. Zenas Horton moved thence to Windsor, Vt.,
where my father was born. Beyond David I did not spend labor
enough to penetrate; but I was rendered nearly certain, I remember,
that he was a grand-son and great-grand-son, respectively, of two certain
Thomas Hortons, one of Springfield, and the other of Charlestown,
Mass., the elder of whom landed in Dorchester, from the
schooner <em>Mary and John</em>, in 1633. Barnabas, of Southold, I remember
coming across, but I was obliged, after following that track for
some time, to give him up, and settle upon Thomas, the ancestor of
David.... I shall be glad to communicate with you further on this
subject. My address I have already given at my office (law), as
above, and believe most sincerely yours,</p></div>

<p class="right fs80">S. DANA HORTON.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have had some correspondence with this gentleman since the date
of the above letter, but he has given no further information as to his
lineage. The above would run thus: 6. S. Dana; 5. Valentine B.;
4. Zenas; 3. David; 2. Thomas; 1. Thomas. Some links are missing,
for certainly, counting from the first Thomas, S. Dana Horton must
be in the 8th or 9th generation. S. Dana wields the pen of a ready
writer, and he has achieved considerable notoriety in the political
reform literature of the day, especially in favor of so using the elective
franchise as to give increased representation to minorities.
Several of his articles have appeared in the <cite>Penn Magazine</cite>, of
Philadelphia.</p></div>

<p><em>Dear Sir</em>: Your letter of inquiry lies before me, supplying more
information than I shall be able to give you. Ours is a Boston family,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A-IV" id="Page_A-IV">[IV]</a></span>
where my father and grandfather both resided. We were six brothers
and four sisters, all of whom lived to their maturity, but of whom
only five now survive. The eldest of these was Rev. Jotham Horton,
of whom you inquire, who died in Boston, in Feb., 1853. His son,
Rev. Jotham Horton, died, a martyr to freedom, by the mob spirit in
New Orleans, some years ago. Our father's name was Jotham, who
was a ship-smith, and did the iron work of the historic frigate
<i>Constitution</i>.</p>

<p>Our family being large, my parents allowed me to go into the country
(Worcester County), at the early age of seven. I was educated a
paper-maker previous to entering upon a course of liberal education.
Thus separated from home, I had less knowledge of our ancestry than
might otherwise have been the case. Supposing that my surviving
brother at Mobile has better information regarding our ancestry than
I have, I take the liberty of forwarding your letter to him, requesting
him to supply any intelligence he may have at hand. He having
been long a resident there, and loyal to the Union, is an ex-Mayor of
the city, appointed by Gen. Pope, and is at present, happily for him,
Judge of Probate for the County. His address is "Hon. Gustavus
Horton, Mobile, Alabama." From him you will probably hear soon.
Wishing you much success in your laudable investigations, and quite
willing to recognize any of our cousins in the Keystone State,</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Rev. Francis Horton, writer of the foregoing letter, was one
of the excellent of the earth. He was a scholar and quite a poet, and
an able and much loved minister of the Word. He died in 1873.
It is highly probable that he was a descendant of Joshua I.</p>

<p>In connexion with this, we give the following thrilling article,
which was published in the <cite>Boston Watchman and Reflector</cite>, soon
after the barbarous murder of the Rev. Jotham Horton:</p></div>


<p class="p1 pfs100">LAST HOURS OF A NEW ORLEANS MARTYR.</p>

<p class="pfs80">AN AFFECTING SKETCH.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Good-by, Emma," he said, "I shall not be gone long. It can't
take more than ten minutes to open the Convention, and then I shall
come right away. Look for me at three o'clock, at farthest," and the
young pastor kissed his wife and hurried away to the city.</p>

<p>That day was destined to be one among the most memorable in the
annals of human wickedness since the famous St. Bartholomew's. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A-V" id="Page_A-V">[V]</a></span>
members of the Union Convention had looked forward to it with apprehension.
They knew that the spirit of the late rebellion still survived
in New Orleans, and they could not hope that they should be
permitted to assemble without some molestation from disorderly individuals,
but they had no suspicions that the masses of the city would
rise against them, <em>organized</em> for deliberate bloodshed. They did not
know that all the arms had been bought up, till the gun-shops contained
not so much as a pocket-pistol. They did not know that the
Mayor had telegraphed to the President that there would certainly be
a riot, and had received the assurance that the military would not interfere
with the civil power. They did not know that the police force
had been increased by the addition of a gang of blood-thirsty men,
and that the municipal authorities had agreed upon signals, and
arranged to begin the riot themselves. Watched by no suspicion, and
awed by no Butler's strong right hand, the conspirators were suffered
to perfect their preparations, and when the morning of the 30th of
July dawned, the treacherous officials appeared at the station-house
fully armed, and waiting the opportunity for their bloody work.</p>

<p>The pastor of the Colleseum Baptist Church, Rev. Jotham W. Horton,
had been requested to open the Convention with prayer. Moved
by the warmest Christian sympathy for the freedmen, this young New
England minister had gone to the South with his wife, to give his best
energies to their welfare. He was a man of sincere piety and a large
heart; pure as a little child, self-denying where duty was concerned to
an extent that often made him suffer, and so peaceable that though
repeatedly insulted, and even once fired upon, and though conscious
that he was fatally marked by malignant disloyalists, he would never
go armed.</p>

<p>After taking leave of his wife, Mr. Horton proceeded in the cars
from his residence in Carrolton to the city. Ever apt to look hopefully
on the worst prospects, and slow to suspect evil of his fellow-men,
he had felt no fears of injury for this day, beyond perhaps a forcible
seizure and commitment to the parish prison.</p>

<p>The hour arriving for opening the Convention, and Mr. Horton
having entered the hall, stood up to offer prayer just as the clock struck
twelve. Strongly and fervently his words came up, breathing petitions
for the peace of his country and the deliverance of the oppressed.
God heard him, but with that prayer His servant's work ended, and
then He gave him for a little while to the cruel wrath of his enemies,
that He might make that wrath praise Him. Immediately on the
sounding of the stroke of noon from the city clocks, and simultaneously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A-VI" id="Page_A-VI">[VI]</a></span>
with the opening of Mr. Horton's prayer, the armed police filed out
of the several stations, three hundred strong, and marched toward the
Institute. Some of them entered the hall during the prayer, a mob in
the meantime rapidly collecting round the door, and hardly had the
good man uttered the closing "amen" when a miscreant fired a bullet
at his head.</p>

<p>There could be no longer any doubt of the intentions of the officers
and the mob. The latter assailed the windows and crushed in at the
doors. "Kill him! kill him!" they yelled. "Shoot every cursed
Yankee in the house!" Just then all the bells in the city began to
toll. It was the preconcerted signal of slaughter, and now the horrors
of the day began.</p>

<p>The disloyalist ruffians rushed in with pistols, knives and clubs, and
commenced their appointed work of murder. Resistance was hopeless.
The Convention broke up in the wildest confusion, some of its members
falling dead, and many mortally wounded in the hall, while a few
who could, fled. The Union men saw that they were doomed. Instead
of protecting them, and arresting the rioters at the firing of the first
shot, as with their force they could easily have done, <em>the police headed
the attack</em>, and there is reason to believe that one of their number fired
the first shot.</p>

<p>Mr. Horton received five balls in his body, and fell. These balls
were fired by policemen. Not satisfied with their work, they seized
him, battered his head with their billies, stabbed him, kicked and
dragged him on the pavements to the first station, the mob following
behind, cursing, beating and trampling him with their shoes.
Thrusting him into a cell, he was left mangled and senseless.</p>

<p>Meantime the shopkeepers of the city had closed their stores, and
strolled about, gratified spectators of the fiendish carnival, greeting the
murderers of Horton, and every squad of policemen that passed them
dragging a bleeding loyalist, with shouts of "Good! good! Kill the
white nigger."</p>

<p>Around the Mechanics' Institute and in the adjacent streets upwards
of one hundred negroes lay weltering in their blood, and the dead
carts drove by loaded with warm corpses and bodies of the wounded
still writhing with life, all tumbled indiscriminately together.</p>

<p>In one of these carts the mangled Horton was flung, after lying awhile
at the station-house, and under a stifling load of dead and wounded
negroes, his stomach crushed in by a blow of a heavy plank, he was
taken to the Marine Hospital.</p>

<p>Furious with the taste of blood, the police and their fellow Thugs
raged up and down some of the streets of the city, calling out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A-VII" id="Page_A-VII">[VII]</a></span>
names of well-known loyalists, declaring their intention to slaughter
every Union man in New Orleans. In the midst of the excitement and
carnage, the bayonets of Federal troops appeared, and further murder
was prevented. The mob dispersed, and the blood-stained streets, and
battered windows, and muffled groans from distant hospital wards
alone testified to the horrors of the 30th of July.</p>

<p>As the hours of that bloody day passed, the wife of Mr. Horton
waited at her home, five miles distant, for his return. Three o'clock
came, the limit he had set for his absence. She looked long and anxiously
to catch a glimpse of him approaching along the familiar street.
He did not come, and her anxiety grew into alarm. To add to her
terror, a breathless messenger arrived at her residence, and warned her
that she would not be safe there that night, for trouble had happened
at the State-House, and the secessionists were searching for all the
Unionists in the city and suburbs. Hastily summoning the negro servant,
she told her to bar the doors and windows, and with a few hurried
preparations then set off for the city, to learn the fate of her
husband.</p>

<p>Having formerly boarded with a Mrs. E&mdash;&mdash;, she took her way
first to her house, and made known her anxious errand. She was told
of the riot and massacre, and at once feared the worst. Several young
men who boarded at the house volunteered to search for Mr. Horton.
They returned late in the evening, but could give her no news, save
that he had been badly wounded. They dared not communicate their
own convictions of his fate.</p>

<p>Only the darkness of the dangerous streets and the restraint of
friends prevented the almost distracted woman from going forth that
night to continue the search herself. As it was, the night brought no
sleep to her eyes, and as soon as it was morning she started on her sad
errand.</p>

<p>Information had been received through the city papers that Gen.
Baird, the military commandant, had released all who had been
arrested and confined by the police, giving the name of her husband
among the rest, and stating that he had returned home. Acting on
this representation, she went alone to Carrolton, but only to return
by the next train. He was not there. Without waiting for breakfast
she set off for Gen. Baird's headquarters; a young Methodist clergyman,
Mr. Henry, one of Mrs. E&mdash;&mdash;'s boarders, insisting on being
her company.</p>

<p>No sooner did Gen. Baird see Mrs. Horton and knew who she was,
than he expressed much surprise that her husband had not been seen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A-VIII" id="Page_A-VIII">[VIII]</a></span>
and told her he had ordered his release. Perhaps she would find him
at the City Hall. To this place she immediately went, but she searched
in vain. He had not been there. She then hurried to the First Police
Station, determined to wring from the brutal officers a confession of
what they had done with her husband. Entering the office, she forced
her way within the rails, and asked of the clerk what had been done
with her husband. The man declared that "Preacher Horton" had
been sent by him to Charity Hospital, and she at once hurried thither.
Again she was disappointed. He had not been seen there! (The truth
was, the cart which carried Mr. Horton's body had stopped there, and
been sent away, as it appeared to be occupied only by blacks.) The
horrible idea now suggested itself to the afflicted woman that her husband
had been conveyed away with a load of dead bodies, and had
been buried alive, but, as a last resort, she determined to visit the
Marine Hospital. This was in a low and distant part of the city, and
devoted entirely to negroes, and she could not have believed he would
be carried there by his worst enemies, but at a friend's suggestion she
sought the place, still accompanied by Mr. Henry.</p>

<p>Arrived at the gate, she was refused entrance, but catching a glimpse
of Dr. Harris, the head surgeon, whom she knew, she called to him,
and asked him if her husband was there. Dr. Harris could give her
no positive assurance, but immediately ordered the servant to admit her.
Forgetting her weariness in her joy that her long quest had at last succeeded,
the faithful woman bounded up the steps, and without waiting
to be directed, rushed in among the patients, found out her husband,
and sank exhausted upon his bosom. What a spectacle! The form
she loved a bruised and helpless mass of flesh and blood, his head
swollen to the size of two, his left arm useless, and his right shattered
and mangled. He moved perpetually about with the restless, nervous
gestures of a dreaming infant. So badly trampled and beaten was
his head and face that his eyes were blinded, and a painful retching,
produced by the injuries to his stomach, obstructed his breath and
speech. But through all the anguish and darkness of his wreck he
knew his wife. That she should have recognized him is a miracle
to all who do not understand the inspired sagacity of a wife's
affection.</p>

<p>"Wipe my face, Emma," he gasped, as if she had been bending
over him ever since he fell.</p>

<p>Worn and broken-hearted, the poor woman sat down by her husband's
side, and tried to strengthen herself for the task of soothing
and comforting his last hours, for she knew too well that he could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A-IX" id="Page_A-IX">[IX]</a></span>
live. Nineteen long hours she had searched for him, and now to find
him thus!</p>

<p>Few comforts were to be found in that hospital, though the attendants,
seeing her distress, evidently meant to treat her kindly. Up to
this time the wounded man had lain in the warden's room, but on
the next morning, which was Wednesday, he was removed to a more
airy apartment. The operation of trepanning was then performed on
his head, though with little hope of permanent benefit. When this
was over, and the burden upon his brain was thus relieved, the sufferer
looked up and repeated,</p></div>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"When I can read my title clear</p>
<p class="verse4">To mansions in the skies,</p>
<p class="verse">I'll bid farewell to every fear,</p>
<p class="verse4">And wipe my weeping eyes.</p>
<p class="verse">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="verseq">"Should earth against my soul engage&mdash;"</p>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Here weakness prevented him, and he whispered to his wife,</p>

<p>"You finish it."</p>

<p>He slept a good deal, but seemed always conscious of his wife's
presence, frequently putting up his restless hand to touch her face,
and remind himself, in his blindness, of her loved features. When
he talked, it was of his unfinished work, his conviction of the justice
of the cause in which he fell, his anxieties for his wife, left alone in a
cruel world, and of his enemies and murderers always forgivingly, as
if they knew not what they did. At different times, too, he spoke
of the riot, relating facts and incidents as I have set them down.</p>

<p>It afflicted him much to leave his wife penniless. He had had a
little money in his pocket when he came to the Convention, but that,
with the gold studs in his bosom, had been plundered by some of the
ruffians who took part in mutilating his person.</p>

<p>Thus he lingered until the sixth day after his injury. When the
morning of Sunday, the 5th of August, came, he remembered that he
had an appointment to exchange pulpits with a colored brother in the
city, and said,</p>

<p>"Emma, we must send word to Bro. Miles that I can't come. I
don't feel quite well enough to preach."</p>

<p>As time went on, his mind began to wander, and he fancied himself
in his own pulpit. He invoked the Divine blessing, he gave out
a hymn and sung, wounded and suffering as he was; his wife, who
wept as she thought of the melody of his own fine voice, joining him
at his request, half choked by her tears. Then he prayed with her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A-X" id="Page_A-X">[X]</a></span>
sung again, and preached, taking for his text, "Out of the abundance
of the heart the mouth speaketh." After these exercises, he expressed
his wish to close with the Lord's Supper, and immediately began the
beautiful ceremony. His wife, anxious to gratify him, skilfully aided
with such meagre conveniences as were at hand, to carry out his touching
fancy. He partook with her what seemed to him the symbolic
bread and wine.</p>

<p>"We both drink from the same cup, Emma," said he.</p>

<p>Another hymn, a benediction, and the sufferer began to grow weak,
as if, indeed, his work was done.</p>

<p>"I am going now, Emma," he whispered. "I'm sorry you can't
come with me. In the fall you'll come."</p>

<p>Then there were no more connected sentences, but incoherent syllables
of prayer, and whispers of saintly hope, "In the vale&mdash;the vale&mdash;home
yonder&mdash;good-by," and at six o'clock that Sabbath evening
the gentle-spirited Horton fell asleep in Jesus.</p>

<p>Thus perished a martyr to freedom and equal rights, as sincere and
pure a man as God ever welcomed "through great tribulation" to the
immortal pleasures of His presence.</p>

<p>To the tender consideration of her friends, never so numerous as
now, and to the merciful consolation of Almighty God, who never
pitied her as He now pities her, we commend the weeping widow,
and pray that she may long live to share the honor of her martyred
husband's fame.</p></div>

<p><em>My Dear Sir</em>: I have received several copies of the "<cite>San Diego
Union</cite>," the last No., April 30, also a copy of the "<cite>World</cite>," March
20th, which contains a picture of San Diego. Also a sketch of the
city on a small sheet, which gives an account of the origin of the new
city, and of your relation to it as the founder and the source of its
enterprise.</p>

<p>For these favors I desire to express my cordial thanks. The growth
of your new city is indeed wonderful, and a brilliant future is certain
to come. Were I a young man, the temptation would be strong to
cross the continent and join in your great enterprise. But my future
is short, and must be devoted to the commemoration of the past.</p>

<p>It has so happened that in my work as the genealogist of my native
town of Union, I have recently devoted special efforts to the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A-XI" id="Page_A-XI">[XI]</a></span>
families of <em>Horton</em> and <em>Burleigh</em>. Dr. Horton, of Terrytown, Pa.,
proposes to publish the annals of the Horton family in this country,
nearly all of whom are the posterity of <span class="smcap">Barnabas</span>, who came from
England.</p>

<p>I have in charge the genealogy of Rev. Ezra Horton, your grandfather,
and have nearly completed the collection of nearly all his
descendants of the fourth generation (to which you belong), from Rev.
Ezra, of Union. I have the names, with dates of birth, of three of
your father's children who (including yourself) were born in Union.
The rest of your father's family I have not. I desire very much to
obtain a complete list of all the children of your father's family, with
date of births, marriages, and deaths, so far as possible. I understand
that your father is still living, though at an advanced age. I
have an obituary notice of your mother, published in a San Diego
paper soon after her death, a year ago last March.</p>

<p>Rev. Lucien Burleigh, the son of <em>Rinaldo Burleigh</em>, of Plainfield,
Conn., is endeavoring to obtain a complete record of all the descendants
of <em>John Burleigh</em>, the first comer of the name to which your
mother belonged. Your mother was first cousin to Rinaldo Burleigh,
who was a long time Principal of Plainfield Academy, and the father
of a number of sons who are well known as writers, and as editors.</p>

<p>I visited Union last week, and saw my uncle, Capt. Chauncey Paul,
and his wife, whose name before marriage was Polly Armour, daughter
of John Armour. They both recollect your father and mother. John
Armour was a near neighbor of Mr. Jacob Burleigh, and the children
of the families grew up together.</p>

<p>The effort of Rev. Lucien Burleigh will result in obtaining full
accounts of all branches of his family. I was able to give him a full
account of the children of the first comer, <em>John</em>, and his wife, <em>Meriam
Fuller</em>, whose ancestry I have traced far back among the early settlers
of Willington and Ashford, in Conn., and in Rehoboth, Mass.</p>

<p>My interest in the two families of Horton and Burleigh, arises not
from the recent efforts to procure genealogies of those two families
by parties specially interested. I have long been engaged in collecting
facts pertaining to the history of Union, my native town. I have
made it a point to study the history of all the early settlers and long
residents. I have traced the ancestry of very many back to England
and Scotland, through the Scotch-Irish emigration, which took place
nearly one hundred and sixty years ago. Very many of the early
settlers of Union were Scotch-Irish&mdash;as the Pauls, the Lawlors, the
Moores, the Armours, the Crawfords, the McNalls, and others who,
like all the race, were genuine Scotch in their character, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A-XII" id="Page_A-XII">[XII]</a></span>
among the best of the emigrants of the olden times. They were not
connected at all with the modern or ancient Irish race.</p>

<p>The Hortons, Burleighs, and Laflins were genuine Englishmen in
their ancestry. So were the Fosters, the Badgers, the Sessions, the
Newells, the Loomises, the Abbotts, and the Waleses.</p>

<p>From that little town, a great many enterprising emigrants have
gone forth to people the mighty West. The people of Union, in respect
to enterprise and education, are higher than the average emigration
of towns in Connecticut and Massachusetts. My long and patient
explorations into the history of Union, has led me to such results as
that I am not ashamed of the fame or the name of my native town.</p>

<p>Having lost all my own children, and always cherishing a sincere
regard for the people of Union, I determined long ago to find out all
I could of their history and the fortunes of their descendants.</p>

<p>The old town holds its own in population and in valuation. I have
a good memory of all who have lived there during the last half century,
and I think the town is as respectable now as it was in my childhood.
Some of the worthy names of the olden time have wholly
gone; though the descendants of some remain.</p>

<p>It is an interesting circumstance, that from that little town <em>you</em> have
gone forth, and on the other side of the new world have laid the
foundations of a great city. Thus New England has sent forth its
best mind and muscle to build up new States in this greatest Empire
of freemen the sun has ever shone upon.</p>

<p>New England was founded by the best people of Old England and
Scotland. I like to look back, and also forward. It is well that all
parts of our great country can be able to trace their origin to common
sources. Great as are the intervening distances in time and space
which separate the different generations, yet are they not wholly
severed in interest, nor ought they to be separated in sympathy. I
hope that my long studies in relation to the families of my native
town, will be of some benefit in making those of the same name somewhat
acquainted with each other; or at least it will prevent those who
are of kindred race and blood from utter forgetfulness of each other.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
